Durban - Jabulani the seal celebrated his 27th birthday uShaka Sea World on Tuesday. Jabulani or Jabu as he is affectionately known, joined uShaka Sea World in 1996 when a group of school children found him stranded on a beach in East London. His name means happiness as he brought so much happiness from the moment he arrived at the old Sea World and hasn't stopped since. When Jabulani arrived at uShaka Sea World, he was estimated to be a sub-adult, which meant he was 4-years-old. According to uShaka Sea World, records revealed that Jabulani only weighed 35kg when he arrived. “Now 23 years later, he weighs a whopping 130kg. This makes him the overall king of the seals with the envious role of dominant male,” the South African Association for Marine Biological Research (Saambr) said. Jabulani puts a lot of effort into herding his harem of seals and keeping them away from the other males. He even sometimes tries to include the animal care staff into his harem, Saambr said. “Although there are many superstars among the seals, when Jabu enters the stage he really owns it. He has inspired millions of visitors to uShaka Sea World to care for the oceans,” Saambr said. Daily News
