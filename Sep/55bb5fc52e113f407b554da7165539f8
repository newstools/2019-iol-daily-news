For 37 years Zimbabweans including myself endured his brutal dictatorship. We suffered many hardships in Zimbabwe and his brutality will never be forgotten. As a result of his dictatorship and misrule, many Zimbabweans fled the country to seek asylum and better economic conditions in South Africa, Namibia, the UK, US and Australia, putting a huge strain on these host countries. It is disappointing that Emmerson Mnangagwa and his government failed to revive the fortunes of a resourceful country. Instead, human rights abuses increased, and the economy of the country is further declining.  The international community should pressure him to democratically change the country, reform the judicial system and revive the economy to prevent any further exodus of Zimbabweans to other countries.
