Durban - Disaster management teams are on alert following a warning issued by the South African Weather Service which warns of the risk of heavy rains hitting eastern parts of the KwaZulu-Natal province, with the risk of localised flooding on Thursday. Sipho Hlomuka the KZN MEC for Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (Cogta) urged communities, especially those residing along the coast to pay close attention to changes in the weather conditions and to take necessary safety steps. “Our province continues to suffer immeasurable harm from climate change which has made it difficult to predict weather patterns. Our communities must take the necessary steps, which include seeking higher ground should there be a risk of flooding in low-lying areas. We also urge parents and teachers to ensure that learners utilise appropriate routes to get to school,” said Hlomuka. Disaster management teams will keep a close eye on areas that are prone to flooding. Motorists are also urged to drive carefully as roads can be slippery due to wet weather. Daily News
