Siyabonga Sokhela, 29, who was stationed at the Ntuzuma SAPS, was certified dead on arrival at hospital. According to police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbhele, Sokhela was shot at KwaDabeka on Saturday. “A case of murder was opened at KwaDabeka police station and a 28-year-old suspect was immediately arrested,” said Mbhele. Sokhela’s mother, Thandazile Tembe, said he had been with the SAPS for five years. She was unemployed and did not know how she would cope. “The youngest of the three children is eight months old, the eldest is 9 years and the other child is 5. I don’t know what I’m going to do with these children; they are dependent on him and now I am left with this burden.” Durban Metro Police spokesperson Senior Superintendent Parboo Sewpersad confirmed that one of their constables stationed at KwaMashu was involved in the shooting. “We are awaiting a preliminary report from the duty officers who attended. Once this report is received, we will decide what steps will be taken against the constable,” he said. Daily News
