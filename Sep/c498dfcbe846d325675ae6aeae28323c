Durban - Swift reaction by police officers led to the arrest of a suspect for hijacking a truck transporting liquor in Umlazi, south of Durban. The arrested suspect is expected to appear in the Umlazi Magistrate’s Court on Monday. On Thursday, the driver of a truck and his crew were delivering liquor to a tavern in T-section, Umlazi when they were approached by four men carrying firearms. Captain Nqobile Gwala, a KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson, said the men forced the driver into the back of their truck and loaded liquor into the two vehicles that they were travelling in. Gwala said the men drove all three vehicles including the truck towards J-section where they were intercepted by the police. One person was arrested whilst others managed to evade police. "A vehicle used during the commission of crime with stolen liquor was seized by police at Umlazi.  The arrested person was found in possession of an unlicensed firearm and he was charged with robbery,"Gwala said.
