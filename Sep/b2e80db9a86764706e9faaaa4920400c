The fence installation began at the end of May and was one of a number of safety measures the eThekwini Municipality had promised to put in place after British musician Simon Milliken was stabbed to death at the nature reserve in August last year. A number of people were also robbed while visiting the reserve. “I think the fence is 80% done so far, there are just a few of the finer details that remain,” Ahmed said. “I’ve seen security guards with guard dogs patrolling the area.” Peace monitor Mary de Haas said she had not been to the reserve for a while, but from what she had previously seen it looked like a strong fence, which was also needed at other facilities, such as the Pigeon Valley Nature Reserve in Glenwood. “Basic precautions at the reserve could include some sort of access control and some rangers patrolling,” De Haas said. After Milliken’s death, it was revealed that the Burman Bush Nature Reserve was understaffed, access was uncontrolled and the fence was easy to get through. The municipality had announced that it would replace the fence, add game rangers and have tighter security controls. Visiting times were also reduced to 12 hours, operating from 6am to 6pm. It was previously open 24 hours a day. Daily News
