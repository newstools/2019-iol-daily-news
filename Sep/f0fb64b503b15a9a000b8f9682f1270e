Durban - The Ohlange pump station near uMhlanga that was spewing out wastewater because of a broken pipe has been repaired. The municipality said the pump station was overflowing into the Ohlange River due a burst 600mm diameter HDPE rising main pipe. The river flows into the uMhlanga Beach and nature reserve. uMhlanga Urban Improvement Precinct (UIP) confirmed that the pipe was repaired. Wastewater was flowing out of the pipe from Tuesday, August 27. Since then all the uMhlanga beaches had been closed to bathers. It was reopened on Tuesday. Nicole Bollman, eThekwini ward 35 councillor, the pipe repair is complete and the line was up and running. The city said the suitable required pipe was manufactured and sourced from Cape Town. It arrived on site on Saturday, was installed and tested. "The three pumps are now on auto and operating at full pressure. City officials are dealing with the rehabilitation of the river. Officials haveÂ  poured chlorine (HTH) during the last construction phase. They are in process of aerating the river,"Bollman said. Msawakhe Mayisela, eThekwini Municipality spokesperson said all repairs were completed and the Umhlanga Lagoon is now open. He said the river is being rehabilitated. The pump station is also situated near a sprawling informal settlement in the Blackburn area. Residents use the road leading to the pump station to access a foot bridge to uMhlanga and Cornubia.
