Jessie Duarte, the ANC deputy secretary-general met with more than 100 councillors from the municipality this week to inform them that the matter of Gumede had been put to bed, “The task is to rebuild the integrity of the city, get all the sections, proper administrative sections, to work properly; get the collection system up and running, make sure that the waste management is handled properly, water provision is handled properly and deal with the issues outstanding with regard to Eskom,” she said. Pulling no punches, the chairperson of the ANC in KZN, Sihle Zikalala, said the municipality was not doing well under Gumede, saying even giving it a 30% mark would have been an exaggeration. He hinted that the axing of Gumede and the entire exco was the beginning of the clean up, and officials would follow shortly. Daily News
