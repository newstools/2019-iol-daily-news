Durban - The KZN Premier, Sihle Zikalala and education and transport, community safety and liaison MECs, Kwazi Mshengu and Bheki Ntuli respectively launched the School Safety Program in Mpumalanga township in Hammarsdale, west of Durban on Tuesday. Recently there was a spate of attacks in schools where teachers, pupils and security guards were killed on school grounds across the province.

As a department we will also take harsh disciplinary measures to protect our children in all places of learning," Mshengu said. Mshengu is also expected to make a groundbreaking announcement which will impact a number of schools in the province.
