This was according to spokesperson Msawakhe Mayisela, replying to questions about the state of the swimming pools at Laguna and South beaches, the deterioration of wooden walkways leading to the beaches, and parts of the wooden fence at Laguna Beach being burnt for braais. Mayisela said plans to revamp the paddling pools were awaiting approval from the architecture department. “There are also plans to repair the sprinklers at the South Beach swimming pools, that used to wet the slide for children.” DA councillor Geoff Pullan, whose ward runs from the Tongaat River to the uMhlanga River, and includes a number of Durban beaches, said putting aside a maintenance budget was important for the city. “There are things that are expected to happen because we are dealing with nature. “That is why, whenever putting in any development, money must be set aside for maintenance,” said Pullan, who has been vocal and active in helping Durban get and keep its Blue Flag beaches. “We should be maximising on tourism using our beaches, but they need to be maintained,” he said.
