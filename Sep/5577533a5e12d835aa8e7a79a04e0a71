Conabeer was last seen on Florida Road on August 19, but was last heard from on August 22. She was missing for three weeks until she was apparently dropped off at her family’s home in Inanda in a critical condition on Sunday. She died the next day in hospital. Nosipho Goba said her niece only had visible bruises on her knee and arm. “She had organ failure and her doctor suspected she might have been poisoned. Her blood tests revealed she had lots of paracetamol in her system and brake fluid,” Goba said. She said Conabeer had been left outside the door at her family’s home in Inanda after midnight on Sunday. Premier Sihle Zikalala and eThekwini mayor Mxolisi Kaunda visited the Conabeer family in Inanda yesterday afternoon. Zikalala said they would follow up with the police regarding Conabeer’s case to understand what had happened and where the investigation was. “We will ensure that the investigation is fast-tracked, but we will also ensure that once the perpetrators are arrested, they are not given bail and also that they are given heavy sentences,” Zikalala said. Kaunda said many summits had been held, but the brutal killing of women and children continued. “With all the efforts, we’ll be able to win this battle,” he said. Daily News
