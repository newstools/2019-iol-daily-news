All candidates from the Universities of Witwatersrand, Cape Town, Pretoria, Walter Sisulu and the Free State failed their final FCS exams. Out of 46 candidates from eight universities who wrote these exams, only 15 - from three universities - passed . UKZN and Sefako Makgatho Health Sciences University (formerly Medunsa) achieved a 100% pass rate; Stellenbosch University had a 75% pass rate. UKZN’s Dean, Professor Ncoza Dlova, attributed their success to the dedication of the head of the department, Professor Bhagwan Singh. Dlova said Singh had made many sacrifices working with registrars at weekends and giving individual attention to registrars who were struggling. “He also creates a very conducive, nurturing and warm environment for his registrars, ensuring that it's easy for them to approach him when they’re having challenges with understanding the content of surgery,” said Dlova. She said Singh’s department worked very well as a team, adding to their success. Dlova explained that a written exam was completed before an oral exam, which would take place next month. Daily News
