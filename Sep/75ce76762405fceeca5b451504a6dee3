Durban -Teams including those from eThekwini Municipality, the KZN Department of Health as well as provincial and national department of home affairs are currently on the ground near Umngcwini stream in Cator Ridge where elevated levels of mercury in the water were detected. On Wednesday municipal spokesperson Msawakhe Mayisela urged residents to avoid contact with the stream adding that samples taken from the stream revealed elevated levels of Mercury. “Our teams are currently on the ground to see what can be done and how this can be rectified, testing of the water will also continue,” he said. Mayisela says the elevated Mercury is as a result of the recent fire at the premises known as Metallica (the ex Thor Chemicals site). “Members of the public are also cautioned against allowing livestock to drink from the water or from irrigating crops using water from the stream until further notice”. About 500 tons of pellets infused with mercuric chloride caught fire at Metallica Chemicals when the roughly 1800 square metre Metallica Chemicals warehouse burnt down. Daily News
