Durban -Â  A teacher at the Tongaat Secondary school has been suspended following allegations of sexual misconduct with a pupil on Monday. He has been caught exchanging graphic material through WhatsApp messages. These include photos and text messages, said spokesperson for the Department of Education in KwaZulu-Natal Kwazi Mthethwa. The teacher on suspension falls within the Pinetown schooling district. "Sexual abuse has been as much a constant feature of South African schools as it has been of society in general. Many of our schools have become violent and unsafe environments, particularly for the girl-child. It is a matter that requires urgent attention from all sectors of the society,"Mthethwa said. He said the DOE stance towards cases of this nature is that it makes schools an unsafe place to be for some of the children. "It suffocates many of their dreams and reduces the school experience for our children to a battle for survival rather than academic achievement. In line with the South African Schools Act, a thorough investigation will be conducted while the teacher is on suspension,"he said. Mthethwa said the DOE distances itself from any sexual harassment/abuse and would not hesitate to act against any sexual offenders within the education sector. Daily News
