Far too many women are bringing up children alone the children’s fathers’ only participation in their upbringing is participating in their procreation. Thereafter, they shirk all responsibility for caring for the life they helped create, not paying child support or contributing to the child's upbringing in any meaningful way. And where fathers or father figures are present, too many are involved in unhealthy, abusive relationships with their partners. Such behaviour gives children the wrong impression of relationships, and the roles to be played by the partners. Further, in the absence of a male role model at home, children tend to idolise and emulate celebrities, many of whom make the worst role models with their objectification of women and focus on bling and booze. I don't believe it is the responsibility of the government to provide role models; families and communities must take care of this themselves. In the same way, it is not possible for the government to put a policeman in each home to prevent spousal abuse or murder. Communities and families must raise their sons to be good, upstanding men who understand that they do not own women or children, and to be able to handle rejection. DEV NAIDOO Durban Daily News
