Durban - A man was arrested in KwaMashu in connection with burglaries he had committed as far back as 2002 in suburbs around KwaZulu-Natal. Police described him as one of the most wanted burglars. Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane, a KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson, saidÂ  police officers from the Durban Central Field Unit acted on intelligence information. They arrested the 36-year-old man at a house in KwaMashu where he was hiding out. Police officers were in possession of a warrant for his arrest. "The suspect was wanted for housebreak-in cases that were reported as from 2002 from Ethekwini up to Mandeni in the north and Scottburgh in the south. Utilising available technology, the highly skilled police officers were able to trace and arrest him. He faces at least 15 cases of housebreak-in in various courts around Durban,"Zwane said. Investigations are continuing to establish if he is linked to other cases in other parts of the province. The arrests comes after seven alleged cat burglars were arrested in September in different incidents of burglaries in Durban. Blue Security armed response officers apprehended seven men and recovered stolen goods ranging from a racing bike to drills, cash and running shoes. These burglaries occurred in Glenmore, the Upper Highway area, Hillcrest, Pinetown and Kloof, Isipingo and Bluff. Daily News
