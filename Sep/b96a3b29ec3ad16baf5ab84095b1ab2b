We, the listeners, demand a change in management and the overall ethos of the station. The management needs to be sacked or demoted. Lotus FM cannot continue like this; change is inevitable. Please bring back Vikash and JJ Mathra, Ray Maharaj and Neville Pillay, and many more capable of doing a better job than the current crop of management, producers and DJs. Gone are the days of the Mathuras, Ray Maharaj, Devi Sankaree Govender, Amith Anand, Mahendra Raghunath, Krijay Govender and Aasra Bramdaw. The music played, presentation and the vibe are at their lowest. DJs do their own thing, and there is no 50/50 South/North music compilation. There are also too many DJs on one programme, talking over each other, stroking their egos with dry jokes and fake laughter. Playing adverts of listeners praising them is also so annoying. The main problem is that the Lotus FM management and staff do not respect their listeners and that is the reason that mediocrity is the order of the day on the station. NJ Prakash Westville Daily News
