Police have arrested 226 people who were found in illegal possession of firearms during the same period. The firearms recovered included 171 pistols and revolvers; 12 shotguns and 10 rifles. "Following the launch of stabilisation operations in the province, a greater focus is directed towards operations aimed at removing illegal firearms from our streets. The reduction in the number of illegal firearms on our communities will have a positive impact on the number of serious and violent crimes that are reported in the province. These firearms are used in inter-group conflicts; taxi violence; armed robberies and stock theft,"Mbele said. Police also applauded the ordinary citizens that have contributed to their successes by tipping them off. Mbele appealed to members of the community to continue working with the police and share information with regards to illegal firearms in their neighbourhoods.
