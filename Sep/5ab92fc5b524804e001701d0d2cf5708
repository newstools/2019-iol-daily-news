Thieves have undoubtedly been engaged in this occupation for some time in many towns. They are ripping off copper pipes and letting water run. Homeowners only discover the problem in the morning when they open the tap and there is no water. Thieves take anything they can lay their hands on. Another bad deed is ripping off telephone cables, and an area is left without phones operating. The other problem is manhole covers being removed. All these stolen items end up in the hands of unscrupulous scrap dealers. They are the biggest culprits, causing everyone problems by buying stolen copper cables and pipes, water meters and other items. The police should undertake to strictly monitor the operations of scrap metal dealers to ensure they are not buying stolen material. This will ensure there is no market for the thieves to take their stolen items to. ISMAIL M MOOLLA Umzinto Durban
