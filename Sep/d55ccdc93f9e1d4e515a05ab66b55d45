Durban - A high angle rescue of a mountain climber was conducted on the mountain tops of Monteseel in Inchanga. Monteseel, inland of Durban, is famous for it’s rock climbing. Gavin Raubenheimer Search and Rescue Convener for the Mountain Club of South Africa (MCSA) said the team was called to assist an injured rock climber on Tuesday. "Two MCSA members were doing recreational Trad climbing on a route named Strawberry Jam. The leader fell and broke his lower leg after he hit a ledge. A call was made to search and rescue and a team and doctor were rushed to the scene. The patient was located below the cliffs with access only from above. The rescue then took place in the late afternoon and evening,"Raubenheimer said. The patient was placed on a stretcher and hoisted to the top of the crag, treated and taken to a hospital. Monteseel is nestled in the valley of 1000 hills between Drummond and Cato Ridge. It is surrounded by cliffs. Traditional (or trad) climbing, is a style of rock climbing in which a climber or group of climbers place all gear required to protect against falls, and remove it when a pitch is complete.
