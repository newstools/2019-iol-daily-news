Police spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane yesterday issued the appeal again after Padayachee was buried at the weekend. He said police had not yet made any arrests. Last Tuesday, the Daily News reported that Padaychee, 32, the co-owner of Re-shape Health and Fitness Centre in Northdale, was found strangled and her hands tied with cables in her Lincoln Meade home. Her body was found by her brother, who became suspicious after she did not pick up her 4-year-old daughter from her in-laws’ house. As news of the murder spread, her family made a call for people not to speculate as this could affect the investigation. On Friday, it was reported that police had found Padayachee’s car, a white Polo, in Hilton near Pietermaritzburg. People with information can contact Warrant Officer Naidoo on 084 905 5564 or Crime Stop on 08600 101111. Daily News
