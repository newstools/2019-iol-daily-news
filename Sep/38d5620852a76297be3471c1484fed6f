The procedure, known as the surgical closure of a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), was conducted by paediatric cardiothoracic surgeon Dr Krubin Naidoo. Naidoo was delighted to have saved baby Ntandoyenkosi. “Good outcomes in such precariously balanced cases are always the result of a collaborative team effort. “We had a great team, everyone went the extra mile,” he said. Ntandoyenkosi, from Elandskop, was born with PDA, a heart defect of a persistent tube-like connection between the two major blood vessels leading from the heart. The PDA usually closes shortly after birth. If it remains open, as is often the case in premature and very low birth-weight babies, blood may flood the lungs and overload the heart. This can result in heart failure, poor weight gain and supplemental oxygen dependency. Daily News
