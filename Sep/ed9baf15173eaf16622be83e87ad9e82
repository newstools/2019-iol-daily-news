Durban - Social media helped bring two wayward traffic officers to court after the niece of a motorist from whom they tried to extort R3 500 posted about the incident on Facebook. Sindisiwe Emmah Mbele’s friends urged in their comments that Bongani Michael Buthelezi (40) and Nomcebo Thandeka Dube (31) be brought to book following the incident prompting the laying of charges. The motorist, Mbele’s uncle, Shadrack Ngcobo, had been asked to pay over the money after being pulled over on a road near Gingindlovu, in May 2017, Both were due to be sentenced in the Durban Commercial Court on Wednesday, having pleaded guilty. However, Dube had a last-minute change of mind to drop Lungelo Ngobese as her lawyer and take on Yenziwe Cele who told an irritated magistrate, Dawn Soomaroo, that her client wished to change her plea. The case had already reached the stage of evidence in aggravation of sentence with Advocate SS Nxumalo, the head of transport in KZN calling for them to be jailed. He said such actions had cost the department public trust and brought it into disrepute. Their sentence was needed to be a deterrent to others, he said. Prosecutor Hazel Siraramen submitted that Cele’s request for a postponement be jeject, accusing her of “delaying tactics”. However, Soomaroo postponed the case to September 3, warning Cele that if her application failed, sentencing would immediately follow. Buthelezi and Dube are on bail of R5 000 each. Daily News
