Ncanana, 34, was then forced to accompany the man, accompanied by his friend, while denying that he knew the woman in question. According to the friend, an argument ensued between Ncanana and the man, who produced a gun and shot him in the head. The man then pointed the gun at Ncanana’s friend, but the weapon jammed. The friend ran for his life, leaving Ncanana on the ground. Happy Ncanana described her eldest brother’s death as senseless. “His friend told us that this man just walked in and demanded that he tell him what is going on between him and his girlfriend. My brother said he did not know his girlfriend, but this man forced him to go with him to the house, which he agreed to. But, on the way, he took another direction towards a nearby cliff and then shot him,” she said. She said the man was fairly new to the community and he and her brother had never had contact or shared a friendship. “It is painful, he died for nothing. It was not a case of mistaken identity - he called my brother by his nickname ‘Sbu’, but my brother did not know him,” she added. She described her brother as a non-violent person. The murder suspect remains at large. SAPS spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala said a case of murder is being investigated by Verulam SAPS. She said Ncanana was taken to hospital, where he died on arrival. Daily News
