Durban - Power utility Eskom said that stage 2 of load shedding will continue until 9 am on Tuesday. In a media statement, Eskom stated that stage 4 load shedding will be implemented on Tuesday between 09h00 to 23h00. This is due to a shortage of capacity. "We remind customers that load shedding at Stage 4 is no cause for alarm as the system is being effectively controlled. Loadshedding is a highly controlled process, implemented to protect the system and to prevent a total collapse of the system or a national blackout. During Stage 4 load shedding, approximately 80% of the country’s demand is still being met," Eskom stated. Eskom’s maintenance teams are working round the clock to return generation units to the electricity system. Stage 2 calls for 2000MW, Stage 3 calls for 3000MW, and Stage 4 calls for 4000MW to be rotationally loadshed nationally at a given period. Eskom appeals to customers to switch off geysers during the day as well as all non-essential lighting and electricity appliances to assist in reducing demand. Eskom advised people to treat all electrical points as live during load shedding. Daily News
