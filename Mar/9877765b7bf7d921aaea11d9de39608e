At a full council meeting on Thursday, the city proposed increases in the water (15% for residential, 15.5% for business), electricity (14,4%), sanitation (9.9%), refuse collection (9.9%) and rates (6.9%) tariffs for the 2019/2020 financial year. A public participation process on the proposed increases needs to be held before they can be implemented.  ANC councillor Lucky Khuzwayo welcomed the proposed increases: “We have to be in line with Eskom’s tariff hikes, because if we don’t, we will be selling electricity at a loss and not generate income for other important services." DA councillor Marthinus Meyer described the proposals as “disgraceful” and “absolutely shocking”, and encouraged residents to voice their objections during the public participation process. Akesh Teeruth of the Stoneham Ratepayers’ Association said: “How are people going to survive? The proposed increases are above inflation, so how do you justify that?” Daily News
