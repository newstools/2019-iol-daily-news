Krish Matai said many informal residents were dumping their rubbish in front of his house and it was becoming “unbearable”. “The whole house stinks. The rubbish just piles up and stays there as no one comes to collect it,” he said. Yesterday was refuse collection day in his neighbourhood, but Matai said this rubbish was left behind by Durban Solid Waste. Ward 25 DA Councillor, Hassan Haniff said he was aware of the rubbish problems around Sydenham. “I have talked to the Durban Solid Waste manager but unfortunately the rubbish truck only comes once a week (on Thursdays),” he said. Krish’s son, Shailendra, said the rubbish has been piling up since the beginning of the month and added that when the trucks pick it up, not all of the rubbish is taken. “Because of the volume of the rubbish, they used to bring someone everyday to clean it up but that stopped two weeks ago,” he said. Haniff acknowledged that the growing number of informal settlements may be contributing to the problem. “There is also a problem with infrastructure since the truck cannot go into informal areas as there are no roads. We advised them to put their trash along the roadside,” he said. eThekwini Municipality spokesperson Msawakhe Mayisela said the city was not aware of the matter. Daily News
