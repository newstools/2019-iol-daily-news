Road Traffic Inspectorate spokesperson Zinhle Mngomezulu said the matter was resolved within an hour. “Pinetown RTI along with the police got there and cleared the road very quickly,” she said. Mngomezulu said there were no arrests and that she could not speak about the motivation behind the truckers’ protest. Police Colonel Thembeka Mbele said a case of public violence had been opened at the Hammarsdale police station. She said a group of about 600 ­people were involved in the protest and that a truck driver had been injured when he fell. Since last year there have been a number of incidents of truck drivers blocking roads, protesting that foreigners are being hired by transport companies. The National Truck Drivers Association said it was unaware of the protest. Sipho Zungu, the spokesperson for the All Truck Drivers Foundation, said the organisation did not know the drivers were planning a protest but blamed the government for taking too long to agree to their demands. Zungu warned there could be more similar incidents before the national elections. Daily News
