The association's acting president, Muhammad Asif Abbasi, said they were no longer able to turn a blind eye to the plight of Kashmiris. “There are human rights violations taking place in Kashmir, along with deaths and displacements. “A lot of people are being martyred,” he said. “We ask that rights be given back to the people of Kashmir.” Kashmir, which lies between Pakistan and India, has been the scene of a territorial conflict between the two countries for decades since the partition of India in 1947. The association said in a memorandum of demands sent to the Indian consulate and the UN that: the South African government should condemn the human rights violations being visited on Kashmiri people. the Indian government should end its military occupation of Kashmir . the South African government should send humanitarian aid and a delegation to Kashmir to witness first-hand the people's condition. Amnesty International reported last year that there had been more than 50000 deaths in the region since 1989. Daily News
