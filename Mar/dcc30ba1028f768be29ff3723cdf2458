Durban - A group of men that conducted a reign of terror in the uMbilo and Glenwood area have been arrested by police. The Daily News has reported on several occasions where pedestrians waiting at bus stops, people walking to work, people taking a stroll on the pavements or students on their way to campus have been robbed by knife or gun wielding criminals. The men were often seen fleeing on foot and then getting into a car parked nearby. Police now believe that they have nabbed the gang. This after Umbilo SAPS Task Team members arrested three suspects for possession of a suspected stolen property said KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala. "The suspects were arrested after a high-speed chase with the police in the uMbilo area. They were found in possession of five cellphones and three car keys. Further investigations revealed that they were robbing the victims on the streets. They will be profiled to check if they are linked to the remote jamming cases reported in Durban and surrounding areas," Gwala stated. The men are expected to appear in the Durban Magistrates Court on Monday. Daily News
