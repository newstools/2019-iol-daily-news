A report by the city council’s security and emergency services committee sought to get authority for the establishment of a “special purpose vehicle” to advance collaboration between the municipality, other spheres of government and non-state actors to advance the implementation of programmes meant to address social challenges. These include drug abuse, homelessness and unemployment. It was recommended that Safer Cities be authorised to establish a special purpose mechanism on the approval of the R500 000 to fund initial activities such as a feasibility study, due diligence-related activities and registration. Deputy mayor Fawzia Peer, who also chairs the security and emergency services committee, said funds were required for intervention in any of the social ills facing the city. Peer said a meeting was recently held with stakeholders including non-profit organisations and NGOs, and the business sector about social challenges. Emerging from the meeting were working groups, of which one was finance, she said. Last year, the city established a multi-sectoral task team, led by Peer, to address homelessness. Daily News
