UKZN spokesperson Normah Zondo said the university was still in talks with the SRC. The talks included funding for postgraduate studies; the university previously said it could not meet demand, despite having allocated R119million for postgraduate studies. Protests last week resulted in UKZN management closing their doors indefinitely at all campuses in the province. Another demand was poor security at the institution's campuses. The Daily News has previously reported that the SRC had complained about poor security at residences. Students also wanted access to wi-fi at their residences. Last month universities across the province were shut down by protesting students angry at the slow registration process, among other issues. The violent protests resulted in the death of Mlungisi Masondo, who was shot at the Durban University of Technology. Zondo said UKZN would embark on a catch-up campaign to ensure they finished the semester in time. UKZN confirmed that seminars and plays at the Elizabeth Sneddon theatre would continue as planned. Mangosuthu University of Technology spokesperson Bheki Hlophe said the university was drawing up a catch-up programme, which would be submitted to its senate this week. Daily News
