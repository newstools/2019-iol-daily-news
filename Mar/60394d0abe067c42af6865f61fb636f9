Durban- The academic programme at the University of KwaZulu-Natal is set to begin again on Wednesday, the university said in a statement late on Tuesday. In the statement, UKZN said all the institutionâ€™s four campuses at Howard College, Westville, Edgewood, and Pietermaritzburg will be open. UKZN however did not comment on whether the differences between the SRC and the university were resolved. The issues the parties were at loggerheads over were the issue of funding for postgraduate studies, security at student residences and WiFi. These differences lead to protests last week that forced UKZN to suspend classes. The opening of the academic programme is the latest chapter in tumultus start to the year for universities in the province. Last month protests rocked universities across the province as students clashed with police as they demanded that their complaints be heard. The clashes were often violent and resulted in the death of Durban University of Technology student Mlungisi Madonsela who was shot at the institution. The damage caused by the protests ran into millions as Mangosuthu University of Technology told the Daily News that the protests resulted in infrastructure damage worth R3.5 million. Daily News
