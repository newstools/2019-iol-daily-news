DURBAN - Eskom has warned political parties to refrain from putting election posters on electrical structures. On Wednesday, Eskom released a statement cautioning against the placement of election posters on electricity poles, meter boxes and mini substations. This, Eskom said, places the lives of those erecting the posters at risk. "The risk is that when someone gets close to or touches them it may result in a flash-over or electrical contact, which may cause serious injury or loss of life. Only authorised personnel are allowed to climb or work on these structures. According to the Electrical Machinery Regulations, no person shall encroach in person or with an object on the minimum safety clearances or require or permit any person to do so except by permission of the supplier or user operating the powerline," Eskom said. The power giant warned that attaching posters to an electrical structure is not only a contravention of the Occupational Health and Safety Act (No.85 of 1993), but also puts the lives of your valuable employees and volunteers at risk.
