Senamile Dlamini, 18, from Nongoma, won a bronze medal in the half-marathon and silver in the unified division. The Special Olympics are for athletes who are intellectually challenged. Over 7 000 athletes from 170 countries are participating in this year’s competition, which ends on Thursday. Dlamini was the only South African representative in the competition. “For us, she was a winner before she even got on the starting block and we could not be more proud to have sponsored her,” said Amanda Khoza, spokesperson for Alexander Forbes, which funded her trip to the United Arab Emirates. Dlamini goes to the Musa Special School. She started running from a young age, despite her disability. Dlamini is expected to get home this week, and a celebration is planned for her at her school.
