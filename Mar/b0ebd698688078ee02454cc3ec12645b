The uncivilised massacre at the two mosques in Christchurch during Friday prayers needs to be condemned in the strongest terms. This act of terror goes against all universal human rights values and morals. I believe this inhuman, racist and fascist terrorist attack is mainly due to ignorance, hate, intolerance, hostility and Islamophobia. This terrorist attack reaffirms what Muslims throughout the world have always believed: that terrorism does not have a race, class, religion or nationality. The mass media need to label the New Zealand mosque attack as an act of terror and not sugar-coat it with terms such as “lone shooter”, “mentally ill” or “deranged individual”. I express my deepest sympathies and prayers to all affected by this sickening act of terror. Global leaders must raise their united voice against hostility to Islam and Muslims. Muslims around the globe positively contribute towards social welfare, nation-building, poverty alleviation, wealth creation and redistribution. The giving of charity in all its forms without any show or expectation of recompense is one of the central pillars and principles enshrined in the Qur’an and Muslims diligently carry out this command.
