A petition signed by 1250 people, consisting of tenants from Syringa Avenue, Westpark Heights, 300 Dr Yusuf Dadoo Street and Kenning Hall, was handed over to the mayor’s office on Wednesday during a march to the City Hall. In the memorandum, residents say they want to remind the city of its responsibility to the people. “We would like the government to step in and assist us by looking for a solution which will benefit all concerned, as we are being bullied and intimidated to move out of the only homes that we know,” it reads. They have given the city until April 1 to respond. The Daily News has previously reported that residents of Syringa Avenue were being evicted to make way for student accommodation. Ward 31 councillor Chris Pappas expressed solidarity with the residents. Good student accommodation should not come at the cost of people being thrown out on the streets, said Pappas. “Although we believe that property owners have the right to do what they want with their properties, we also have to consider that the government is not providing sufficient social housing for people and they are being thrown out on the streets because they don’t have options,” he said.
