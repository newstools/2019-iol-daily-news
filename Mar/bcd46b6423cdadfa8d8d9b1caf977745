Having driven through the Pietermaritzburg CBD recently, I agree that it is in an appalling state, disgraceful to be called our capital city. That the Msunduzi Municipality allowed this state of affairs to develop and persist is shocking. All responsible should be dealt with in the strongest terms. We should all try to support the initiative by getting involved in whatever manner is possible within our means. Businesses can adopt the areas in front of their premises and ensure these are kept clean and tidy, and homeowners should take care of their verges. Those unwilling to join in will soon realise that only their areas are untidy and will soon join in. Above all, prevention is better than cure, so perhaps the government should partner this worthy initiative with a simultaneous effort to address littering. G HARRIS Durban
