The 37-year-old, whose name had not been released by the police, was driving his wife to work when the men attacked them. The robbers, described as three armed men, forced the woman to give them cash and her cellphone while her husband lay in a pool of blood. Police said they were still looking for the robbers. Blue Security community and media liaison officer, Andreas Mathios, said the man was driving along a dirt road in the neighbourhood between 7am and 7.20am when a gang of armed suspects ambushed him. “Three suspects, who were in a white Toyota Tazz, had been hiding behind some bushes and two of them jumped out and ambushed the man and his wife,” he said. Mathios said one of the robbers leapt toward the vehicle and pulled open the driver’s door before firing two shots at his head. “The suspects then demanded cash and a firearm from the victim’s wife and fled the scene in the Tazz with a sum of cash and her cellphone. Provincial paramedics who responded to the scene declared the victim dead,” said Mathios. Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said a case of murder was opened at Pinetown police station. Daily News
