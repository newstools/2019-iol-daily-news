Skipper Khaya Zondo said the weather was a huge factor in getting crowds into the stadium - however, the weather is expected to be sunny and hot (tomorrow) Thursday. “We'd like our fans to come through and support us, and help us defend the title. It always helps to have a home crowd behind you. It gives you an extra 10% boost, so it would be nice to have them here,” Zondo said. If the Dolphins win and the Multiply Titans lose, the Dolphins could have a home final. KZN Cricket chief executive Heinrich Strydom said playing in front of their home crowd should be a massive advantage. “I urge all local cricket lovers to come and be a part of this quest to retain the Momentum Cup,” he said, announcing a special buy one, get one free ticket deal for fans. The game starts at 1.30pm on Thursday. Tickets range from R30-R100 and can be bought at Kingsmead Stadium or www.ticketpros.co.za. Daily News
