I have been a supporter for a long time, since the Banana Boys days when the Purple man-eaters used to keep us out of the A division. It looks like the players can do whatever they like and still get fat cheques, win or lose. The players have no discipline and no pride playing for the Sharks jersey, and the coaching staff have no idea what to do if plan A does not work. Backline players like the two wings and fullback are out of position most of the time, as are the props, and the forward coach is out of his depth. Parking at the stadium is a problem, the food stalls are very poor, bars understaffed and the security staff arrogant with supporters. And then Gary Teichmann and his management wonder why the stadium is empty. How can we keep on supporting the rubbish of the recent weekends? I also feel that those players who are going to play overseas, like Akker van der Merwe and the Du Preez brothers, should go now. Reynhardt van Rooyen Durban Daily News
