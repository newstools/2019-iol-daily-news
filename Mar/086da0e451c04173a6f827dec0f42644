Durban - KwaZulu-Natal police management have condemned the posting of a video clip on social media which shows the re-enactment of a real life domestic violence situation. Brigadier Jay Naicker said the re-enactment formed part of a module for domestic violence training that police officers are mandated to attend. The video comes just days after a video went viral of Mandla ‘Mampintsha’ Maphumulo assaulting Bongekile ‘Babes Wodumo’ Simelane. Naicker said they suspect that a police official who might have attended this training intervention at our Durban Training Center last year, could be responsible for recording this scene and posting the clip on-line. “We are indeed perturbed and believe that this individual was extremely malicious because of the timing of the release of the video,” Naicker said. He said KZN police management have launched an investigation to identify the perpetrator and ensure that he or she is brought to book in terms of our internal disciplinary regulations. “We are requesting members of the public who are in possession of the video clip not to repost it. Whilst it is clear from the classroom setup that this is a training session, some may not immediately realise that and will be disturbed by what they see,” he continued. Daily News
