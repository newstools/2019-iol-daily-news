Durban - Businessman Vivian Reddy opened a state-of-the-art children's home for the KwaMashu Family and Child Welfare Society that was built at a cost of R10 million by his charity arm, the Sibaya Community Trust. The KwaMashu society which for 30 years operated from a shack now has offices, a library and computer room, aftercare facilities, a learning wing with a kitchen and canteen and a hall. Reddy, chairperson of the Sibaya Community Trust handed over the building to the chairperson of the KwaMashu Family and Child Welfare Society, Ronald Cele. “This special project has been 18 months in the making and we are the delight to officially hand it over to such a deserving organisation. When we first received KwaMashu Family and Child Welfare Society’s (KFCWS) pleas for assistance, we were deeply heartened by the tremendous work they were doing in the community, despite very limited resources and from severely inadequate premises,” Reddy said. Before the new building was sent the KFCWS had nearly 41 staff members who worked out of a three-bedroom house. The staff had also built a shack which provided protection from the elements for visitors while staff had to make use of a small, secure office to access printers, files and other administration necessities.
