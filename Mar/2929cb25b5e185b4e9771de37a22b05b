Durban - A woman escaped with head and spinal injuries after she allegedly steered her car down an embankment and onto the awning of a home in Verulam on Tuesday. The passenger was not injured in the accident and did not require medical attention said Prem Balram a spokesperson for private security company Reaction Unit of South Africa (Rusa). Both were trapped in the Mercedes Benz after it crashed through a wooden barrier and went down an embankment, a few meters below road level, and smashed through the awning of a house. Firefighters from the Ethekwini Fire & Rescue Services used pneumatic tools to open the car doors and free them. "A 68-year-old woman was transported to Umhlanga Hospital. According to the driver she was approaching her home when she felt dizzy & weak. Instead of turning into her driveway she suddenly accelerated towards her home," Balram said. Daily News
