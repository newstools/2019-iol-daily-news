Details on the matter are sketchy and the Lamontville Taxi Association said it would release a statement today. Sbusiso (Boy) Shazi and Sibonelo Mazibuko, his bodyguard, were killed in a hail of bullets when unknown men fired at their vehicle. Mandla Mnyandu, spokesperson for the taxi association, said they worked well with Shazi and said their association was running smoothly. “We will only comment via a media statement once the committee of the association has met. You will have to respect that decision. I can tell you that the man worked with us and he is our member; that’s all I can tell you now,” Mnyandu said. Provincial police spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said two murder cases were under investigation. Zwane said the two were killed while sitting in Shazi’s Mercedes-Benz at the corner of Pendlebury and Leicester roads in Mobeni on Saturday at 7.45pm. “It is alleged that they were shot by unknown suspects while in their vehicle. The investigation continues,” Zwane said. He said this was the second incident this week where the motive behind a killing was suspected taxi violence. On Thursday, a taxi boss was shot and killed at a Tongaat fuel station. Daily News
