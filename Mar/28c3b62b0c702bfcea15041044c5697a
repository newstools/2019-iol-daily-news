Durban - The theft of two scooters from a property in Westville was not taken lightly by the community on Tuesday. Mike Myers, a spokesperson for Mobi-Claw 911, said a panic button activation was received from a client. Myers said a thief had stolen two kids scooters. Myers said access to the property was gained by breaking the wooden fence and then taking the children’s scooters from the yard. "The client had activated his emergency to his local neighbourhood watch who mobilised. One of the watch volunteers noticed the suspect walking on the highway with the scooters and informed our client who then activated Mobi-Claw 911," he said. Myers said the police were notified and the Pinetown motorbike squad arrived promptly to comb the area. "It wasn’t long before the SAPS members had eyes on the thief who had made his way into the bushes. Minutes later the thief was arrested and the goods recovered.  Absolute tenacity by the volunteers of the Dawncliffe Westville Community Watch and an off duty policeman to track the suspect down. An amazing response from the SAPS Pinetown Bike Unit which resulted in the arrest. Well done to you all," an elated Myers said. Daily News
