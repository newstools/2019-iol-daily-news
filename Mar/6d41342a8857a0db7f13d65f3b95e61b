I was distressed after seeing a disabled man trying to climb steps because he could not use lifts, since they were out of order due to load shedding. It is unfair that we are experiencing such inconveniences because of incompetent leaders. Eskom’s problems have persisted for a very long time, but no one has been able to solve them. It is not that Eskom’s problems are unsolvable; the problem is that clueless leaders are in charge. But I am happy that elections are around the corner. I will vote for DA. This party has proved beyond doubt that it is capable of delivering, and is always emphasising that people must be appointed on merit. We are experiencing this crisis because people get employed through connections. Romanius Zulu Durban
