This incident smacks of racism through and through. The ANC government and its officials have sat back and waited for the matter to ride on. Nurse Samantha Fayers was tagged as coloured by the ANC government and its Department of Health. The racial tagging is still very much alive and well in South Africa. I was born here in KwaZulu, and not in KwaZulu-Natal, and proudly hold my South African identity document. I do not owe allegiance to India or any other country in the world,and I will defend my country with the last drop of my blood. I also distance myself from being called Indian, when I am not, and will not allow morons to get away with name-calling. We are a free nation, with no blacks, whites, Indians and coloureds; rather, we are all collectively South Africans. The government must act seriously against those officials making racial judgments against its people. Samantha Fayers and her kind are Godâ€™s divine darlings, serving humanity in sickness, and we must show our utmost respect to them. Daily News
