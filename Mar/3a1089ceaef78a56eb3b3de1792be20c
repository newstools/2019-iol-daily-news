That Sizwe Mchunu, the former DA KwaZulu-Natal leader, was among the first crop of black leaders who joined the DA about a decade ago, and has now ditched the party and joined the ANC, is not surprising. Mchunu, a seasoned leader, dumped the party with three other Indian councillors from Pietermaritzburg. Like Patricia de Lille, and other prominent black leaders, they no longer felt at home with the DA. There have been so many defections from the DA of late that one begins to wonder whether there is an insidious vein of racial prejudice against members who are critical to the slow pace of change within the party. Mchunu had great oratory skills combined with astuteness of debating. He also had his finger on the pulse of national challenges. The DA debacle in the Western Cape and the stubbornness of the leadership to acknowledge its shortcomings made him cross the Rubicon. There are strong indications that other black DA members will be following Mchunu to join the ANC. Azmeera Nazir Reservoir Hills
