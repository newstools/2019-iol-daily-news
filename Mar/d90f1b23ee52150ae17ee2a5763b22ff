Yet it should be of some concern to adults that there are children taking time off school to “show that they care about the environment”. Apparently they have been inspired by a Scandinavian schoolgirl who has learning problems. She will probably be helped to make up for all the lost lessons, but will all the others? Schoolchildren should not miss school (truancy it used to be called) except under exceptional circumstances. Why could they not gather at a weekend? What the children should do is encourage the cleaning up of the environment, as is being done in Britain and promoted here. Then they should go home after school and collect vegetable and garden refuse matter, cut it into small pieces and make compost for their garden, even if they only have pot plants. The water in the home can be recycled by putting “grey” water (used, soapy) in the cistern instead of yanking on handles or chains to flush potable (drinkable) water down the toilet. The Earth would benefit much more from this type of sensible behaviour than from all the marching around with placards. Daily News
