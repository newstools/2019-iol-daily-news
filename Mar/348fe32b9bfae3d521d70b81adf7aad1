Fifty people were killed and 50 injured. In his manifesto, the shooter conveys a deep hatred for people who aren’t white, who he calls “invaders”, as well as intense anti-Muslim sentiment throughout the document. With each mass shooting, we’ve seen how social media and the racist, Islamophobic words, of politicians and the media, have prompted people to commit these acts. In the aftermath of the Christchurch shooting, Australian Senator Fraser Anning blamed the tragedy on immigration, which sounds very similar to what Donald Trump has said in the past. The real cause of the bloodshed is unchecked xenophobia, which inspires people to commit unspeakable crimes. Brenton Tarrant is a white supremacist who acted out of hatred, not fear. It is necessary to recognise that this was an act of terrorism, because a massacre is not a side-effect of mental illness. Saif Soofie Durban
