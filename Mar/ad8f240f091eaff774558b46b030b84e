Durban - A Westville couple were robbed inside their home in Glendale Road on Wednesday. Captain Nqobile Gwala, a KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson, said the robbery occured just after 7 pm when three men walked into the home and instructed the couple to sit on the floor. "With guns pointed at them, the suspects robbed them of cellphone, TV, laptop and jewellery.  They fled the scene in a complainant’s blue Toyota Aygo. The vehicle was later recovered in Wiggins Road, Cato Manor," Gwala said. A case of robbery was opened at Westville for investigation. Last week Tuesday, thirteen people were held up during a prayer meeting in Cedar Road. Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane, a police spokesperson, said the church group members were doing bible study lessons when four suspects entered the house by forcing a door open just after 9 pm. "The suspects took laptops, jewellery, TV, cellphones and two vehicles. Both vehicles were later recovered in the Chesterville area," Zwane said. Daily News
