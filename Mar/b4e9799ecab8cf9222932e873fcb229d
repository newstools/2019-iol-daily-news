In the wake of load shedding, especially stage 4, medical essential service providers such as the provincial department of health and Netcare have contingency measures to minimise the impact of load shedding. However, surgery at some hospitals had to be rescheduled as the air conditioners in operating theatres were not connected to back-up generators. On more than one occasion, Eskom has made the move from stage 1 and stage 2 load shedding, to stage 4. Health spokesperson Ncumisa Mafunda said hospitals in the province had back-up generators. “In cases where an outage may be experienced, contingency measures are implemented to minimise the impact. Where necessary, this may include diverting or transporting patients to neighbouring hospitals that may not be affected by the power outages at that given time,” Mafunda said. Netcare hospital division managing director Jacques du Plessis said they were fully equipped for power outages. “Patients can also be assured that power outages will in no way interfere with medical procedures that may be under way.” A nurse at a Durban government hospital said that while there was a generator, some theatre cases had to be rescheduled because air conditioners were not connected to it.
