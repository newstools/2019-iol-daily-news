Durban - Thousands of people wanted to be one of the first ones through the doors when Markro in the Cornubia precinct first opened those very doors on Wednesday morning. Some people started camping outside the store from as early as Tuesday evening. The first customer was a woman, and she started queuing from 8pm on Tuesday. Makro communications manager, Welisa Nene, said by the time they opened, the queue was so long that it made its way out of the parking lot and out the gates. Nene said everyone was excited and very pleased to be there. “It was great environment. The mayor, Zandile Gumede was there, King Zwelithini, Lloyd Cele and Danny K was also there,” Nene said. She said the people were excited to see them there. She also said it was the 22nd Makro store opened in the country and the fourth and biggest in KwaZulu-Natal. “This is the first store with an online drive thru. You order online and drive thru to get your items,” she said. She also said the first person in line, received a R5 000 shopping voucher. Moreover, the deals Makro has today will run until March 31.
