The DA announced its candidate for the position, but celebrations ended when the red berets announced they would field their own candidate. All that’s needed now is support from the ANC and the DA will be out in the cold. The EFF’s policies resonate better with the ANC. The EFF has been vocal and unwavering on land expropriation without compensation. I dare say that the coalition with the EFF was the biggest factor that contributed to the DA’s lost votes to the FF+. While the DA grapples with its position on affirmative action and black economic empowerment, the EFF is clear this form of redress is critical to advance the principles of the National Democratic Revolution. The EFF wants more for its black support base and the DA is protecting the interests of its predominantly white constituency. Malema is a shrewd politician. He knows what to say to bring in the votes and was successful in keeping the (Mmusi) Maimane DA in check. It’s perfectly understandable for him to say he will find it difficult to negotiate with John Steenhuisen and Helen Zille, the new DA leaders. Malema says if the DA does not support their candidate in Joburg, then they will “remove” the Tshwane mayor, elected with EFF support. Malema holds the trump card and it’s difficult to imagine Malema and Zille reaching agreement. Politics is not for the faint-hearted and textbook politicians. Malema is groomed in ANC trenches and heads a party with growing support. He won’t risk that by going into bed with a party that wants to shed its non-racial image. Malema has put the cat among the pigeons and forced the DA into a cul de sac. Visvin Reddy Durban Daily News
