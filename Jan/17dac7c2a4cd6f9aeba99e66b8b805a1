Durban - The KwaDukuza Municipality is looking at opening up 63 new access routes to its beaches on the north coast following an audit which found that people had difficulties in accessing the beach in many areas. This was after public coastal access to municipal beaches had become a pressure point for the municipality, mainly because of historical access restrictions, the city said. Nhlanhla Mdakane from the municipality said some of the challenges included providing reasonable coastal access to previously disadvantaged communities, addressing private access and illegally closed public access routes. “Access to the coast is a right outlined in the ICM Act, and as a municipality, KwaDukuza is responsible for ensuring reasonable access to coastal public property within its jurisdiction, which extends from the Ballito beaches in the south to Zinkwazi in the north,” Mdakane said. He said this includes popular beaches such as Salmon Bay, Ballito, Willard, Thompson's Bay, Shaka's Rock, Salt Rock, Sheffield, Tinley Manor, Nonoti, Blythedale and Zinkwazi. He also said the municipality is now validating the 63 coastal access routes before they are formally designated as Coastal Access Land. In order to manage these areas, the municipality plans to develop a set of coastal access bylaws. “This process will also ensure that environmentally sound access points, both new and existing, are utilised and it will prevent unlawful restrictions on access rights. KDM aims for all beaches to be used, managed, protected and conserved through the Beach Nodes Development Framework and the current Beach Maintenance Plans,” he explained. He said through the assistance of Economic Development, Tourism and Environmental Affairs (EDTEA) and the Department of Environmental Affairs (DEA), the municipality is on its journey to develop a KwaDukuza Public Coastal Access Plan.
