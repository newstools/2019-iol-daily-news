Durban - Four days after a critically ill Loggerhead turtle washed up on the uMhlanga beach it has started to move her head on Wednesday. The KwaZulu-Natal Marine Stranding Network reported the turtle was rescued by the Lifeguards at Umhlanga main beach on Sunday. The turtle was taken to South African Association for Marine Biological Research (Saambr) at uShaka Sea World for treatment by the Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife Since Sunday, the turtle has been named Destiny by staff at Saambr. Although Destiny is still critically ill and barely able to move, she has started slowly lifting her head which is a wonderful sign and the first glimmer of hope. Veterinarians have done X-Rays which showed large volumes of sand in her stomach – some of which they managed to remove. Destiny, according to Saambr, is currently receiving fluids and electrolytes via a catheter and being left to rest. Hopefully she will make it through the next few critical days and start responding to movement in her environment. Daily News
