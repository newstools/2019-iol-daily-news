Durban - Thirty-two people have been arrested and 74 unlicensed firearms were recovered by police in KwaZulu Natal over the festive period. Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane, a KZN police spokesperson, said the police operation was carried out in a 6 day blitz between December 16 and 22 December in various parts of the province including areas such as Ulundi, Ezakheni, Bergville, Emanguzi, Mtubatuba, KwaKhutha, Nsuze and Port Edward. Zwane said the police officers were following up information about illegal firearms across the province and they raided few homesteads in various areas. "A total of 818 ammunition was found. The suspects were charged with possession of unlicensed firearms and ammunition. Such operations will continue aiming to get rid of illegal firearms and reduce faction fights, stock theft, minibus taxi related cases and other serious crimes. We appeal to the public to work together with the police by sharing any information about illegal firearms in their areas," he said. Police found 67 pistols, two shotguns, three rifles and two homemade firearms. Zwane said all the recovered firearms will be taken for ballistic tests to establish if they were used in any other crimes in the province. Daily News
