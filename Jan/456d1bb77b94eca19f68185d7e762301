Durban - A knife-wielding woman who went door to door allegedly threatening her neighbours in a block of flats in Mayville was detained by police. Andreas Mathios, Blue Security spokesperson, said residents alerted the company’s control centre to the incident at around 2.30pm on Sunday. “An armed response officer and the police responded to the scene. The woman had been captured on video camera, going from door to door, threatening residents with a large knife. She eventually locked herself in the bedroom of an apartment. A concerned friend had to climb through a window above the internal door to get her out. Police arrested the woman for her own safety and took her in custody to the Mayville police station. No injuries were reported,” Mathios said. Mayville police station had detained the woman but it could not be confirmed if the woman had been charged with any crimes.
