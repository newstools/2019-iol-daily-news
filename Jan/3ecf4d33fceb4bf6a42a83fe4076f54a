Chatsworth resident Robin Singh, 62, died on impact, said Amawele Emergency services spokesperson Sivan Subramodey. He said paramedics had arrived to find Singh under the car, near the Moorcross off-ramp. “The only way we could medically assess the patient was to lift the car. A tow truck came to our aid. Medical officer Lukcanis Padayachee reported that the patient had severe head injuries and bilateral fractures to both his arms and legs,” Subramodey said. Subramodey said Singh had no identifying documents. “We cannot speculate whether he was robbed or not. We found him without his trousers, and his shirt was shredded.” Singh, who lived in Damarosa, was on his way home at the time. Subramodey said the family reported him missing on Tuesday. When he saw the picture, he realised the patient he handed over to police was Singh. David Singh said he learnt of his brother’s death on Wednesday. “Robin was returning home from the new casino at Ayesha Centre. We believe he was robbed and was running from his attackers.” Police spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala confirmed a missing person report was opened at Chatsworth SAPS. Gwala said a case of culpable homicide was reported on January 7 after an unknown man was knocked down by a vehicle on the Higginson Highway. Daily News
