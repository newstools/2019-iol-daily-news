The woman, who did not want to be named, said she arrived at 7.30am last Thursday to join the queue. She estimated that there must have been 200 people in the queue before her. “At 9.30am, an official said he had a skeleton staff and we would have to wait until 1pm. By 11am the line had only moved by 10 people,” she said. “How does he (official) operate his department? He should know how many people he can accommodate in a day. By midday people called on him (for answers). Again he said we must wait until 1pm so he can issue tickets for us to come another day. A fierce argument broke out between him and the people,” she said. Since former home affairs minister Malusi Gigaba’s visit to the Umgeni offices in April as part of his “war on queues” campaign, nothing has changed. Eventually, at 1.45pm the woman was given a piece of paper with a date for her to return written on it. She was told they would try to accommodate her on that day. “We also witnessed lots of bribery. Someone offered to take me inside the offices for R250,” the woman said. Nosipho Shandu, Home Affairs spokesperson, said they take the allegations seriously. She said all office staff are currently working overtime. Daily News
