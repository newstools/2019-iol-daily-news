Kwenzekile Myende, 28, who gave birth to a boy at GJ Crookes Hospital in Scottburgh yesterday, said she had never been to a doctor to determine the gender of her child, but believed that the information on the internet that said her child would be a boy was correct. “I love using the internet and I know that there is a lot of information on it. I had a desire to have a boy as I already had a girl. I searched the internet for the telltale signs of a child’s gender. I found that it was a boy and when he was born, it was really a boy. I was so happy about this,” she said. She was one of 36 women who were congratulated by Health MEC Dr Sibongiseni Dhlomo yesterday. Myende said her son, Owami, was due on January 7. “I already had a name in mind as I knew it would be a boy. Even if it was a girl, I still would have named her Owami,” she said. The first New Year’s baby at the hospital belonged to Tholakele Mbhele, 28, from the Nyavini area. She did not know the gender of her baby during her pregnancy. Of the 36 babies born at state hospitals yesterday, 17 were boys and 19 were girls and three of them were born at GJ Crookes Hospital. Two 16-year-old women were the youngest to give birth in the province, Dhlomo said. During a press conference, Dhlomo said many mothers who die during or after delivery are under the age of 20. He added that 8 to 10% of women who give birth in South Africa are younger than 20. “Young mothers often go to health facilities late because they are hiding their pregnancy. (Sometimes) there are complications that could have been resolved if they had gone to the health facilities sooner. If we can decrease the number of young people under the age of 20 getting pregnant, then the number of young mothers who are dying during delivery would also decrease,” he said. Daily News
