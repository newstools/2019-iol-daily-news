Durban - A burglar, shoplifter and a petty thief were put behind bars after being caught by Blue Security. Blue Security spokesperson, Andreas Mathios, said an alleged shoplifter was arrested on the corner of Boscombe Road and Sylvester Ntuli Road on the Durban beachfront after she stole a pair of slops from a shop. The incident occurred at around noon on Sunday. “The officer responded to the scene of the crime, tracked the suspect down and recovered the shoes. The suspect was handed over to Durban Central SAPS members at the scene,” Mathios said. In a separate incident, armed response officers who responded to the scene of theft in Ethelbert Road in Malvern arrested two men who had allegedly stolen two chairs valued at around R5000 from a property. “The officers patrolled the area and managed to track down the two men who they spotted walking along the road carrying the chairs. They arrested the men and handed them over to the Malvern Police at the scene,” Mathios said. Mathios said in Shepstone Road in Athlone Park, an armed response officer arrested an alleged housebreaker after he gained entry into a property at around 5.30pm on Saturday. “The suspect climbed over a back wall and broke a window before forcing open a burglar guard to gain entry into the house. When our officer arrived at the scene he spotted the suspect climbing out over the back wall. He gave chase and managed to arrest him,” Mathios said. The suspect was handed over to the Amanzimtoti police at the scene. Daily News
