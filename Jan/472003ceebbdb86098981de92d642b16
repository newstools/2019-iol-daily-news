Durban - A female teacher at a private school in Salt Rock on the KwaZulu-Natal north coast has been fired for  “inappropriate behaviour” with a 16-year-old boy pupil at the school. According to the North Coast Courier the school launched an investigation into the conduct of the English teacher after rumours in the school community suggested that the pupil and the teacher had had a sexual relationship. The boy's parents approached the school with the information. However, an investigation by the school has ruled out any sexual activity between the pair. According to the Courier, two sources from the private Salt Rock school told the paper that the 24-year-old, married teacher was under investigation after the parents of the boy brought the matter to the school’s attention. The school’s executive head Samantha Smith released a statement on Friday saying the investigation, which concluded on January 16, did not show any evidence of a sexual relationship but that the teacher had been dismissed for inappropriate behavior. “The disciplinary hearing commenced on January 10 and was concluded on January 16 under the chairperson of an independent labour consultant. “Following the recent article in the North Coast Courier, I would like to state that there was no evidence whatsoever of a sexual relationship,” said Smith. Smith said swift action was taken to protect all parties involved. The teacher, who did her in-service training at the school since July was placed on staff in December. Daily News
