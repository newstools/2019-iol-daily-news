Truck driver Vinesh Lewis said the renewing of PDPs and driving licences had been offline at RTI Winklespruit for two months. Lewis, 53, said he and his son had been trying to renew their PDPs since November last year. He said he made both short and long distance journeys using his PDP. “Our PDPs have already expired and whenever we went to renew, we were told they are offline,” Lewis said. The Isipingo resident said they were not given other options and they could not apply for temporary PDPs because of the same reason. “We had to phone around and check where else we could renew our PDPs. “We found that Umzinto and Mooi River were online, but Umzinto had also been offline for at least two months,” he said. He said on Thursday they went to Umzinto to get their PDPs renewed after they were told that Winklespruit was still offline. According to Department of Transport spokesperson, Mluleki Mntungwa, some testing grounds fall under municipalities and the ground in question is under the eThekwini Municipality. Senior manager for Metro Police, Rajen Reddy, said he was on leave when the transport departments were offline and he only knew there was a delay in the issuing of the driving licence cards. “The machines which are used for eye testing and fingerprinting, were offline. And it wasn’t only in Winklespruit, but across all centres,” Reddy said. He said the centres had been facing this problem for two months. “They are all online now,” he said. Mntungwa said there is still a driving licence backlog. “A lot of people have not received their driving licences. “However, there is a number people can SMS to check their licences. People can also apply for temporary licences,” Mntungwa said. Drivers can check the status of their cards by sending their ID number to 33214. Daily News
