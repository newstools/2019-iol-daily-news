Durban - The mother of Kiara Mun-Gavin who was badly injured in a horror crash in the Durban North on Christmas Eve is hoping she will be able to take her daughter home on Friday. Jaci Mun- Gavin said that they were hopeful their daughter would be going home today. "However, after the doctor examined Kiara he said her wound needed more time to heal before she can come home. We are hoping by Friday she will be able to come home." Kiara and Jaci had been on their way to the Anthem Church in Mackeurtan Avenue when they were involved in an accident with a delivery motorbike. Kiara suffered an extensive brain injury. Shortly after doctors operated on Kiara they had to remove a large part of her skull because of the swelling in her brain. The skull was placed in her abdomen for preservation. Jaci said even though her daughter would have to return to the hospital in two weeks for cranioplasty operation to replace the skull it would be nice to take her home. She described her daughter's improvement as rapid and said all her therapists were happy with Kiarás progress. Daily News
