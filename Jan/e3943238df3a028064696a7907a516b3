Speaking to the Daily News outside court after the three accused - Phumlani Nojiyeza, his brother, ward 88 councillor Mthokozisi Nojiyeza, and Nkosinathi Mbambo - were denied bail, Sithembile Maphumulo was still overwhelmed. “I have mixed emotions. Although nothing will bring my husband back, I am consoled by the court’s decision to deny the men bail. My child was robbed of a father. My husband did not live to meet his child,” she said. She said she believed that the decision not to grant the trio bail was because there was strong evidence against them. “I believe that this is the beginning of justice for my husband. I am relieved that the alleged killers will be kept in jail for the duration of the trial.” She was heavily pregnant when Sibusiso Bhabhane Maphumulo was gunned down on October 18. She gave birth two months later.  Maphumulo was in his car after a meeting in the township’s V-section when another car parked next to him and the occupants opened fire. Magistrate Thulani Mbuyazi said all three men failed to convince the court to grant them bail, saying there were no exceptional circumstances. He said for the purposes of the trial, the State had a strong case. He added that the manner in which Maphumulo was murdered had become a matter of public interest. “The murder was allegedly politically motivated. The second accused (Nojiyeza) is a politician and the third accused (Mbambo) has a pending murder case of another politician,” he said. He said all three wanted bail so they could take care of their families, but there was no evidence before court that suggested their families would not be able to cope in their absence. He said the court was not swayed by the petition by the uMlazi community of uMlazi against bail being granted, but was convinced of the evidence before it. “All the accused failed to prove that they would be prejudiced if they were not granted bail, therefore bail is denied,” said Mbuyazi. The matter was adjourned to April 2. Daily News
