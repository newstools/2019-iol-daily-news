According to Blue Security spokesperson Andreas Mathios, the son had got out of the car to open the gate to their property when the hijackers appeared and held him at gunpoint. His parents were ordered to also get out of the vehicle and his mother started screaming. Mathios said the hijackers, who were driving a white Nissan, had allegedly followed the man and his family to their home in Springfield, north-west of Durban, at around 7.40pm. “One of the suspects held a firearm to the child’s head. The boy remained absolutely calm while they had the gun to his head. “His father and mother got out of the vehicle, and his mother started screaming, which seemed to aggravate the hijackers.” Mathios said that the situation could have been much worse had the 10-year-old, who had a gun pointed to his head, had panicked. Instead, he had remained calm. Mathios said the boy’s bravery during the ordeal was to be commended. “He was extremely brave and did not show any outward signs of panic. His brave response helped to minimise the chance of violent injury to his family,” Mathios said. The hijackers then forced the child’s father back into the vehicle and drove off in the direction of uMlazi. A search, which involved members of the SAPS Flying Squad, Alpha Alarms, Blue Security and the local neighbourhood watch group, was immediately launched. “The man was later found at Philani Valley Mall in uMlazi, where the suspects had dropped him off. “Fortunately, he was unharmed,” he said. Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said the man told police he was returning home from shopping when he noticed a vehicle parked next to him as they arrived. “Four men got out the vehicle and dragged his family out their car. “They pushed him back to his vehicle, drove off and dropped him off at Philani Mall,” she said. Mbhele said a case of carjacking was opened at Sydenham police station for investigation. Daily News
