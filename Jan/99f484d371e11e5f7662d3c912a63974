This was according to district spokesperson Mdu Dlamini, speaking on progress made by the municipality’s disaster management team. “The damage assessment done so far clearly reveals that an integrated emergency relief and sustainable intervention is urgently required. It’s worth mentioning that most of the affected households are already in not so good socio-economic status. By looking at the type of houses and vulnerability of their locations, one could easily conclude this about the well-being of the affected households,” he said. Dlamini said that while some houses could be repaired, a “serious RDP housing project” was required. He said unfortunately some of the damaged property, such as furniture, gadgets and electronic appliances, could not be recovered through municipal intervention programmes. “Various stakeholders must be activated from a local level to respond to this incident,” he said. Dlamini said assessments were ongoing in Jozini and Umhlabuyalingana. The district and local municipalities had already provided relief material and a joint operations committee was activated to secure assistance from other stakeholders such as Sassa, the Human Settlements Department and disaster management. “A meeting with human settlements was co-ordinated and a report with a beneficiary list was presented to the department to commence with applications for funds to assist the affected families,” said Dlamini. He said the Department of Co-operative Governance’s disaster team had a meeting with the head of human settlements to speed up the process of releasing funds to assist affected families with structural repairs and rebuilding,” said Dlamini.
