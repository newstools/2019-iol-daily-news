Having experienced financial struggles to fund his undergraduate degree, becoming a successful neurosurgeon did not come easy to the uMlazi-born Enicker. His education was funded with the assistance of his late grandfather and through loans. “My grandparents played an important part in my upbringing. My grandfather, Basil Mdege, was a principal at Swelihle High School in uMlazi until he retired. He was strict and a disciplinarian He was instrumental in putting me through medical school.” Every year young people struggling financially flock to tertiary institutions seeking education, but the lack of funding contributes to a large drop-out rate. According to a study of first-year students recently conducted by Subethra Pather, an academic development lecturer at the Cape Peninsula University of Technology, money troubles contributed to the 40% drop-out rate. The study showed almost 94% of students surveyed rely on bursaries or scholarships to study. Many have taken part-time jobs and do not spend a lot of time on campus. Enicker, 41, resident neurosurgeon at the Inkosi Albert Luthuli Central Hospital, made headlines in November when he led a team of doctors who performed surgery on jazz artist and University of KwaZulu-Natal music lecturer Musa Manzini. Manzini was awake during the six-hour operation to avoid paralysis or loss of function in the part of the brain that controls voluntary movement. Awake craniotomy - the removal of part of the bone from the skull to expose the brain - is the standard of care in many centres internationally. Enicker’s memories of growing up in uMlazi in the 1980s and 1990s include a strong sense of community and playing soccer in the streets. He attended primary school in uMlazi and attended St Francis College in Mariannhill up to matric. “My family had instilled in me the importance of education from a young age,” he said. Daily News
