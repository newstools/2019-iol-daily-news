Juggernath, 34, was killed on the corner of Flower and Ganesh roads in Clairwood two weeks ago. The family believed Juggernath had been killed because sibling Ritesh Juggernath’s bar was robbed at gunpoint and Sanjay had provided police with CCTV footage of the incident. The men, Bilal Shaik, 41, Alistair Govender, 34, and Brandon Armugan, 28, had been “prematurely discharged” from hospital, said their lawyer, Abdul Karrim. Shaik and Armugam walked with the aid of crutches while Govender had his left hand in a bandage. Karrim told the court the trio had all undergone surgery as a result of gunshot wounds. Shaik had a plate inserted into his hip and knee, Govender had pins and a plate inserted in his elbow and Armugam had plates and a pin inserted in his leg. The fourth accused, Leon Veerasamy, appeared in court last week. Magistrate Vanitha Armu adjourned the matter for bail consideration on January 15 when all four would appear. Armu, at Karrim’s request, sent the injured accused to Westville Correctional Services Hospital to recover. Sanjay lived with his parents and ran a gym and a nightclub in Clairwood. Sanesh Juggernath said he believed Sanjay had been shot numerous times from behind and a bottle had beensmashed on his face. The family said Sanjay’s gym had saved many youngsters in the area from a life of drugs and alcohol. Sanesh said: “The accused are well-known to the family. They all grew up in Clairwood. They overplayed their role in court by limping and pretending to be in pain. They were looking for sympathy. Now that we have escalated the case to be investigated by the Provincial Organised Crime unit with Warrant Officer Rajen Nagesar as the investigating officer, we can see results. “The men were in hospital from December 22. This is a very traumatising incident. The family is still devastated. We hope they are jailed for a long time,” Sanesh said. Daily News
