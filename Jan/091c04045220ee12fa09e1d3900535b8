Durban - A prominent trail runner has urged people to dispose of their waste responsibly. Rhyan Rudman, a Durban resident, made the statement after he walked through the Krantzkloof Nature Reserve on Tuesday. He said people should be more responsible even when discarding chip packets. Rudman said he found lots of stuff on one trail in the Kloof Gorge. "A pair of ladies slip flops, someone’s tread, aQuellélabel shows me how important our environment is to you. To the manufacturer you need to change the behaviour of your consumer and take responsibility to educate on the damage plastic is causing to our environment," he said. In 2017,  Rhyan and his wife Susan Rudman climbed Mount Everest to raise funds for the Thula Thula Rhino Orphanage in KwaZulu-Natal through the initiative. Rudman remarked before the trip that wildlife was South Africa’s heritage and should not be used for human consumption. Daily News
