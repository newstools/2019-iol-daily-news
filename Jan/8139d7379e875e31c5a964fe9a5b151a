The KwaZulu-Natal Marine Stranding Network reported that the very sick and lethargic creature was rescued by lifeguards on Sunday. The turtle, named Destiny, weighed only 58kg (she should weigh about 100kg) and was covered in an excessive amount of barnacles. Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife took Destiny to the South African Association for Marine Biological Research at uShaka Sea World for treatment. The network reported that she had a tag on the flipper and notches in her shell which told them interesting things about her life. Destiny was tagged 14km south of the Mozambican border on December 31, 2005, in the South African Turtle Nesting Programme. It was recorded that she nested at 10.48pm on an evening with clear skies and a fresh breeze. The notching told researchers she had hatched close to Kosi Bay between October 1982 and March 1983. This makes her 36 years old, and she nested at the age of 22. Although Destiny is still critically ill and barely able to move, she has started slowly lifting her head and given her carers a glimmer of hope. X-rays showed large volumes of sand in her stomach - some of which the veterinarian managed to remove. Destiny is receiving fluids and electrolytes via a catheter and being left to rest. Incidental ingestion of sand was normal, said the association, but the volume of sand Destiny had ingested was not normal and was a concern. Daily News
