Municipal spokesperson Buyi Mthiyane said the protest action had disrupted the delivery of services. He said its cause was not known to municipal management or councillors as the workers had not presented a memorandum or communicated their grievances formally. The Daily News’s sister paper, Isolezwe reported last week that Ndlela’s secretary, Zanele Gabela, was arrested after a year-long investigation. She faces allegations that she had sent Ndlela an envelope containing a bullet and a note with a threatening message. Staff have downed tools and disrupted services since her arrest. “It is true the municipal manager, Thabisile Ndlela, received a threatening letter with a bullet inside the envelope. The matter was handed over to the SAPS for investigation. We have no further comment on that investigation at this time,” Mthiyane said. Disgruntled staff gathered outside the municipal offices in Camperdown yesterday. Police spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said officers were on the scene monitoring the situation. Despite the protest, a council meeting went ahead yesterday where the annual report for 2017/2018 was tabled. Mkhambathini Ward 3 councillor Emmanuel Nkosinathi Phungula said the speaker made no mention of the crisis. Councillors were told to wait for a feedback report from mayor Eric Ngcongo. “Many questions have been left unanswered. The workers said they would not return to work unless the municipal manager is removed. Services like the licensing office, office of grants and other key components are closed,” Phungula said. A woman said she had visited the offices to pay for her car licence for the third time since last week, but it was closed. She said the staff were outside the building, burning tyres. “We apologise for the disturbance caused by the workers’ protest. We are working to resolve matters speedily,” Mthiyane said. Daily News
