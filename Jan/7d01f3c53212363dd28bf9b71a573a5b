Durban - The Democratic Alliance is expected to visit the BAT Centre, on Monday, to meet with arts industry experts on the challenges and struggles faced by artists in eThekwini and KwaZulu-Natal, as they look for support to practice their craft. The visit comes amidst the ongoing controversy where former President Jacob Zuma is alleged to be receiving preferential treatment from eThekwini’s Parks, Recreation and Culture to secure funding for a music record deal allegedly worth R25 million. The DA is expected to lead a delegation to the centre including their Team One SA Corruption Spokesperson Phumzile van Damme. The BAT Centre was established in 1995 and has built its image on focusing on observing the quality of the arts and performances displayed by local artists within the municipality. The BAT strives itself on developing artists. The BAT Centre AIR Programme aims to help young talent creatives to become successful, entrepreneurs and to train others creating sustainable job opportunities. Zuma could become a recording artist after reaching an agreement with eThekwini Municipality to record his popular struggle songs.The move, which is part of ensuring the preservation of heritage, will see the former president starting a new music career. eThekwini parks, recreation and culture head Thembinkosi Ngcobo said Zuma would lead a yet to be formed Durban Mass Choir, which will back him. Ngcobo, who led a team of officials and politicians to Zuma’s Nkandla homestead on Friday to lobby him to record the Struggle songs, said he “surprisingly” agreed to the proposal. Ngcobo said the municipality had taken the initiative to record Zuma after noticing his singing talent on stage, especially when he sang the iconic Awuleth’ umshini wami song. Daily News
