Durban - A dangerous criminal will appear in the Hlabisa Magistrates Court on charges of illegal possession of firearms and ammunition on Thursday. Captain Nqobile Gwala, a KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson, said the suspects were wanted for several cases including the attempted murder of police officers, murder, robberies and carjacking. It is alleged that they were terrorising the community of Ezibayeni, Hlabisa, Nongoma, Mtubatuba and surrounding areas. They were arrested by the Empangeni Tactical Response Team who acted on a tip-off with regards to that a gang of robbers were travelling in a vehicle using false plates. "The team spotted the said vehicle with five occupants travelling along KwaTebha area and attempted to intercept the vehicle. A shoot-out ensued and the men abandoned the vehicle. A 24-year-old man sustained a gunshot wound. He was arrested at the scene after he was found in possession of an unlicensed firearm with five rounds of ammunition. He was taken to hospital where he is under police guard," Gwala explained.  The 24-year-old man will be profiled to establish if he is linked to other crimes within the province. With the assistance of police officers at Ezibayeni SAPS, the team continued with their investigation and proceeded to a house at Gabadela area in Ezibayeni. "A 65-year-old woman was arrested after she was found in possession of an AK47 rifle with nine rounds of ammunition. Police are still searching for the remaining suspects. The arrested suspects appeared at the Hlabisa Magistrates Court on Wednesday. They were remanded into custody until Thursday," Gwala said. Daily News
