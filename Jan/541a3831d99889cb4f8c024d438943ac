Durban- The family of the Clairwood businessman and bodybuilder who was gunned down allegedly by four hitmen in December will have to wait until next month to hear if the people accused of the murder would get bail.  Sanjay Juggernath was killed on the corner of Flower and Ganesh road in Clairwood on December 22 after he was shot 17 times and died at the scene.  Hours later the police arrested people who were charged with his murder.  Leon Veersamy, Brandon Arumugan, 28, Alister Govender, 34, and Balal Shaik,41, are all facing a charge of murder.  The family members from Durban and out of town and community members of Clairwood were left disappointed on Tuesday when the formal bail application did not take place as the four men were not brought to court.  Only Veersamy was brought to court on Tuesday, the other three accused were not brought to court and nobody knew where they were kept at Westville Prison.  Veersamy told the court that he was being kept at another section of the prison.  The last time the two of the accused were in court, they were on crutches as they had been injured during the arrest.  Their lawyer, Abdul Karrim requested the court to ensure that the accused were not sent to the prison cells, but to the prison hospital where they would get medical attention.  "Except for one accused, the three other accused were badly injured during the arrest and need medical attention. I request that they are kept at the Westville Prison hospital," he said.  The family, friends and community members who packed the courtroom yesterday in anticipation for the formal bail application, were disappointed again when the matter was remanded to February 19.  The long adjournment is due to the unavailability of the investigating officer who will be on leave until next month.
