Durban - The cause of an electricity outage in Phoenix, unit 9 area, was attributed to an explosion at an electricity mini-sub station in Southvale Avenue on Thursday. Residents reported huge flames emanating from the substation in Rydalvale. eThekwini ward 49 Councillor Tino Pillay said the cause of the fire will be investigated by the municipality. Pillay was waiting for a report on the extent of the damages. He said some parts of Rydalvale and Eastbury were affected. "I must commend the electricity department for their prompt and efficient response to the situation. Residents must remain patient while the problem is resolved. It could take an estimated 24 hours to effect a repair. The officials on site will keep me updated. The eThekwini call centre will also give live updates," he said. Pillay said there were no houses in the immediate vicinity and he ruled out any possibility of illegal electricity connections being made. Daily News
