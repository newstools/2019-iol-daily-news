Durban - Two suspects who were arrested over the weekend after they were found to allegedly be in possession of illegal firearms and ammunition are expected to appear in the Weenen Magistrate's Court on Tuesday. They face charges of being in possession of unlicensed firearms and ammunition. Among the firearms recovered was a R5 rifle, a double barrel shotgun and a CZ75 pistol. The two aged 41 and 55 were arrested in two separate incidents in the Weenen Area. According to police spokesperson Lt Colonel Thulani Zwane, the 41-year-old was arrested on January 18 in the Emanseleni area of Sahlume after he was found to be in possession of an unlicensed .38 revolver as well as a 6.35 pistol. "The revolver had four rounds of ammunition in it and the pistol had one round of ammunition in its chamber." The second suspect was arrested by the Pietermaritzburg Public order Policing Unit and the Ladysmith Tactical Response Unit. "The officers had sourced valuable information and pounced on the suspects home where they found him to be in possession of an unlicensed R 5 rifle with its serial number filed off. The team confiscated a CZ75 pistol with 17 rounds of ammunition and a shotgun with 10 rounds of ammunition." Zwane said the firearms were found in a cupboard instead of being in a prescribed gun safe. "The police officers were ambushed when they were leaving the premises. Fortunately, none of them sustained any injuries during the ambush." He said during the operation a 12 gauge double barrel shotgun without a serial number was found abandoned. Daily News
