Dlodlo, who formed part of a delegation that visited Prince Mshiyeni Memorial Hospital along with Health MEC Dr Sibongiseni Dhlomo, said she had been to many hospitals around the country and observed patients waiting for long periods for files before they could see a doctor. “People must not sit on the bench the whole day to see a practitioner,” she said. But she was non-committal on when groundwork would be laid or when the health-care facilities would go online, but could only say that it would be done in “record time”. “We would be working together with the Health Department to develop standard operating procedures for record keeping,” she said. Dlodlo’s visit was part of inspections her department conducts to ensure that departments provided efficient services to the public. Daily News
