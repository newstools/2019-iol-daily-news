Clairwood residents had packed the Durban Magistrate’s Court to rally behind his family in opposing bail for the men. The family was frustrated by the development, which they described as negligence that displayed no sense of urgency in the case. Only Leon Veerasamy was brought to court and no explanation was offered in court about his co- accused’s whereabouts. Juggernath was killed on the corner of Flower and Ganesh roads in Clairwood on December 22. He was shot 17 times and died at the scene. Hours later the police arrested people who were charged with his murder. Veerasamy told the court he had no idea where his co-accused - Brandon Arumugan, 28, Alister Govender, 34, and Bilal Shaik, 41 - were and that they had not appeared at the last hearing on January 10. Arumugan, Govender and Shaik had previously appeared in court on crutches. They had been hospitalised soon after their arrest and were being kept under police guard at Westville Prison hospital as they sustained injuries during the alleged murder. Juggernath’s brother Shanesh said: “This is nonsense. Why would the police not bring suspects to court when that is what they are paid to do? These people are obviously having a picnic in jail and no one cares that they are supposed to be in court.” He added that relatives had travelled long distances to attend the hearing and see justice being served. “This is a waste of our time. We are angry that no one communicated to the court the reasons why they were not brought to court,” he said. The case was adjourned to tomorrow to allow for all the accused to be brought to court.
