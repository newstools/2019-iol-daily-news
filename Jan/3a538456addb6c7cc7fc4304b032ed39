Durban - A dozen residents involved in a violent service delivery protest will appear in court, in Escourt in the KwaZulu-Natal midlands, on Friday. Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane, a KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson, said that on Thursday at 08:30, a group of approximately three hundred community members barricaded Mimosadale turnoff at Malanspruit in the Escourt area with burning tyres and tree trunks. Zwane said they were complaining about a lack of water supply to their area. "Twelve suspects aged between 20 and 50 were arrested for public violence. They are set to appear in the Estcourt Magistrates Court," Zwane said. During the road closures, on the R103 between Estcourt/Frere and Mooi River motorists were advised to use alternative routes. There were also reports of cars being stoned on the road towards the N3 at Midway. However, police could not verify this because the incidents were not reported. Zwane said police are monitoring the area. Daily News
