Durban - The next lunar eclipse which can be viewed on January 21 will be notably unspectacular from South Africa as the eclipse begins as the moon sets in South Africa, said Dr Daniel Cunnama, Science Engagement Astronomer at the South African Astronomical Observatory (SAAO). According to the Astronomical Society of Southern Africa (ASSA), this will be one of two lunar eclipses which will occur in 2019. “The first is a total lunar eclipse on January 21st and is visible from the Middle East, Africa, Europe, the Americas, most of Oceania and easternmost Russia. From southern Africa the event is marginal, as the moon sets around the time the eclipse begins at 04:35am, mid-eclipse is at 07:12am,” the society said. The society said the lunar eclipse is visible from anywhere on Earth where the moon is in the sky at the same time. A lunar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes into the shadow of the Earth, becoming dim until emerging from the shadow. The Earth's shadow consists of two parts – the dark inner umbra and the lighter outer penumbra. In a calendar year between four and seven eclipses can occur; at least two, and at most five, can be lunar eclipses, the society said. “If the Moon's orbit coincided with the ecliptic, there would be a lunar eclipse every Full Moon, but because of the changing orientation of the orbit, lunar eclipses occur only infrequently. Total lunar eclipses last for up to 100 minutes but do not require eye protection (unlike solar eclipses),” the society said. The society said the second lunar eclipse is a partial one on July 16 or 17 and can be seen from Australasia, Asia (except in the north and east), Africa, Europe (except northernmost Scandinavia) and most of South America. From southern Africa, the Moon will be well-placed throughout the duration of the eclipse. Mid-eclipse is at 11:30pm and the umbral magnitude is 0.658. Daily News
