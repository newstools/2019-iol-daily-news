Durban - A private security company's efforts in tracking down a stolen vehicle in Verulam, on Thursday, could have been in vain. Shortly after 7:30 pm Suren Balram of Trans Natal Flying Squad security received information of a motor vehicle which was stolen in the KwaDukuza (Stanger) area. Balram received the tracking coordinates and swung into action searching the Missionlands area where the signals were emitting from. "Upon arrival in the Missionlands area, a general patrol was conducted and the vehicle fitting the description was spotted. The vehicle was located in a tow truck company scrap yard. The police were notified. I later learnt that the vehicle owner was slapped around by a person known to him. During the course of the argument, the car was taken. The owner had been advised not to open a false case at the police station," Balram said. Police were unable to confirm if a case had been opened at the KwaDukuza police station. Balram advised people to stop reporting false cases to avoid a waste of resources by emergency services. Daily News
