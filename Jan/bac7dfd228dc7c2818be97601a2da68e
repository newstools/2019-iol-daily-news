Durban - What would I do with R110 million? That is the question that most South African will ask when they head out to buy a lotto ticket in the next 48 hours following an announcement by National Lottery Operator, ITHUBA that following a rollover on Monday the PowerBall jackpot increased to a Guaranteed R110 million. In addition, the PowerBall PLUS climbed up to a guaranteed R40 million – bringing the total jackpots to a Guaranteed R150 million. The jackpot is one of the biggest in the history of the South African lotto and could go up even further by the time the draw is held on Friday night. ITHUBA’s Khensani Mabuza says that it is exciting that the South African National Lottery is able to provide such attractive jackpots. “This is a historic moment for the South African National Lottery, for players to be playing for such massive jackpots," Mabuza said. "What makes us happier as the operator is that we are able to give South Africans an opportunity to win big, right here at home. This translates to more players playing the South African Lottery games, and that is good news for the country’s social economic sector, particularly if you consider the lottery contributions towards benefiting good causes,” she said. The total R150 million jackpot comes just in time for the anniversary of yet another historic jackpot by the current National Lottery Operator. In January 2018, 4 winners shared a whopping Guaranteed R110 million LOTTO jackpot. As to how high this PowerBall and PowerBall PLUS jackpots will go, ITHUBA says, no one knows. Friday the 25th of January 2019 might just be the day that one or more South Africans join the list of the country’ s most wealthy. Daily News
