Durban - The KwaZulu-Natal MEC for Transport, Community Safety and Liaison, Mxolisi Kaunda has called upon the police to work tirelessly in finding suspects implicated in the killing of two men at Glebelands Hostel yesterday. Department spokesperson Kwanele Ncalane said according to a police report a group of people stormed block 50 and 51 at the hostel and fatally shot two men on Sunday night at 8pm. "We call upon the police to work around the clock to find suspects implicated in this shooting," said Kaunda. The shooting occurred on the eve of the appearance of eight suspects implicated in various crimes including murder in the hostel. Meanwhile, Kaunda has sent his deepest condolences to the family of an off-duty policeman who was shot dead in Hammarsdale. Welcome Sithole, 41, a member of the Durban flying squad unit, was visiting his family members at unit 6 in Hammarsdale. "It is alleged that there was a car following him, while he was driving towards Sibisi road, suspects opened fire towards Sithole and he died from multiple gunshot wounds. "Police must work diligently to ensure that these perpetrators are brought to book. We condemn the killing of police officers, the only shield we have between heartless criminals and law-abiding citizens. We also encourage the community to come forward with any tangible information related to the two incidents so that those who are implicated can face the full might of the law," said Kaunda. Daily News
