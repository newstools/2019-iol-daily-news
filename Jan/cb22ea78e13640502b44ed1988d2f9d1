Durban- The family of Bianca Parsons, the 33-year-old woman who was shot in a case of mistaken identity in full view of her three-year-old daughter came face to face with the families of the men accused of killing her. The families packed the Durban High Court on Monday for the start of the trial but were left disappointed by a delay. The delays are to give the state and the defence to sort out certain pretrial procedures. State Advocate Kelvin Singh said the trial is expected to start tomorrow. Darryl Murrisson, 33, and Christopher Houston, 26, both from Wentworth are have been charged with murder and attempted murder. They are both in custody after Houston was denied bail by the Durban Regional Court last May, while his co-accused, Murrisson had chosen to abandon his bail application and had confessed to shooting Parsons. He claimed that he was actually supposed to shoot a man who was in the car the same colour as Parsons parked at the service station at the time. Houston and Murrisson were allegedly seen on CCTV video footage driving in a white VW Polo into a petrol station in Wentworth following a red Chery QQ3. Parson's red VW Polo vehicle had arrived first and parked while she waited in the car for her husband who was inside the shop in the car. Houston is allegedly seen taking a gun and tucking it in his pants and they both walked to the shop. The CCTV footage allegedly shows Murrisson buying a pie and a bottle of water and walking out of the shop. Outside Murrisson is allegedly seen firing two shots at Parsons who was in the red VW Polo with her three-year-old daughter in the back seat. It is alleged that the hit was intended on a member of another family member who was in the red Cherry QQ3 related to the shooting of Houston's relative who was killed outside a nightclub in Wentworth last year.
