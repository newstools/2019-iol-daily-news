The 14 mobile Muvo card vehicles travel to various areas where the buses operate to assist commuters purchase or top up their Muvo smartcard. SA Municipal Workers’ Union (Samwu) spokesperson Dumisani Luthuli said members complained about working conditions on board the vehicle. He said their grievances included that the air-conditioners were not working, unclean on board toilets, smoke emanating from the on-board generators that power the cash tills and not enough tickets to sell to the public. Staff have to remain inside the vehicle throughout the day wherever it is stationed. “When stock runs out they are subjected to verbal abuse from the commuters. There was also an issue where a call was made for the suspension of a senior manager who made insulting remarks to a staff member,” said Luthuli. “Due to the cash nature of the business, employees requested to be escorted by security guards to prevent armed robberies.” Luthuli said work had commenced but management was given until Monday to rectify all the issues. EThekwini municipality spokesperson Msawakhe Mayisela said there were no disruptions to the bus service. “We are aware of a labour relations issue raised by the ticket selling personnel. "Management engaged with staff on those issues and the matter was resolved,” he said. The Chief Operating Officer at Transnat, Stephanus Joubert, said Muvo staff are employed by the eThekwini City Fleet. “When I heard about the problem I instructed all drivers to assist passengers who did not have balances on their cards to travel for free. We could not inconvenience our passengers. The issue was resolved and hopefully the Muvo sales are back to normal,” Joubert said. Daily News
