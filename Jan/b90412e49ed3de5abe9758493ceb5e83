This was according to fellow officers who had worked with him over the years at the eThekwini Metro police force, speaking at his funeral at the eManzimtoti Civic Centre Mourners included members of the Saps, Road Traffic Inspectorate and Fire department. Deysel died earlier this month when he was struck by a taxi at a roadblock outside Galleria Mall. Deysel’s colleague Constable Nevesh Nameekumar said he had known him for 10 years. He said his partner took pride in his uniform and went the extra mile for people when conducting his duties. Nameekumar said he was proud to have known him. “A true legend full of love and strength,” he said. Nameekumar said Deysel would not have wanted people to be sad at the funeral but to celebrate his life. He said Deysel would often talk about his wife and gloat about her achievements. Deputy mayor Fawzia Peer offered her condolences to Deysel’s wife, Rina. “I feel your pain,” she said. Peer said policemen and their families had a difficult time as they were not sure they would return home each time they left for duty. She said police officers often worked in difficult circumstances without expecting a “thank you” from the people they served. She said this was sad as police were the backbone of the city. Aart Verrips described his friend as a private person. He said the family had received much support since Deysel’s death. Verrips thanked the emergency services for their help at the scene of the incident. Nhlakanipho Cele, who is alleged to have knocked Deysel, faces charges of culpable homicide. He was granted bail of R2000 in the eManzimtoti Magistrate’s Court last week. Daily News
