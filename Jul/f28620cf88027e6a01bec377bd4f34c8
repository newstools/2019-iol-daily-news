For an advocate to make a sworn affidavit that is untruthful is a severe misdemeanour. But her servile supporters will continue to support her, like the EFF, BLF and Jacob Zuma's cronies. This is the same public protector candidate that the DA had reservations about. She must go, and the sooner the better. Her reputation is in tatters and she has compromised her office. The punitive costs order against her is the most severe censure the court could impose against her. Why she would want to hang on to her office is anyone's guess? Her failure to uphold the integrity of her office is nothing short of shameful. Please leave for the sake of bringing sanity to the office and restoring some prestige to the work the public protectorâ€™s office is supposed to carry out. Paks Pakiriy Durban North Daily News
