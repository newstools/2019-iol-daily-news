Durban - A woman has been rushed to hospital after being mauled by a rottweiler in Isipingo,south of Durban on Wednesday. Dhevan Govindsamy of PT Alarms said his ambulance service rushed to the scene in Lotus Park to treat the woman. "The woman is believed to a domestic worker. She was allegedly mauled by a rottweiler at the premises she's employed at. It was a very gruesome attack. The victim was severely bitten on the head, both arms and neck,"Govindsamy said. PT Ambulance services treated the woman before transporting her to the nearest hospital for further treatment. Researchers have found that Pit Bulls and mixed breed dogs have the highest risk of biting and cause the most damage per bite. Parents should also avoid dogs with wide and short heads, weighing 30-45 kg, suggested the study published in the International Journal of Pediatric Otorhinolaryngology. "The purpose of this study was to evaluate dog bites in children, and we specifically looked at how breed relates to bite frequency and bite severity," said study lead author Garth Essig from Ohio State University in the US. "Because mixed breed dogs account for a significant portion of bites, and we often didn't know what type of dog was involved in these incidents. We looked at additional factors that may help predict bite tendency when breed is unknown, like weight and head shape," Essig said Daily News
