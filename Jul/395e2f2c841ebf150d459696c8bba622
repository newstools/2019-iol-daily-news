The loss of Sadia, an innocent young child, was unbearable not only for the family, but also for the community of Chatsworth. Sadly, we are not safe anymore, be it in our homes or while going to school. With poverty and unemployment on the increase, we are becoming soft targets. Individuals and parents need to become a cohesive body of active citizens, and join street committees to curb crime, especially during school hours. Anarchy will prevail if there is no onslaught from the police to curb crime. To the Sukhraj family: we know Sadia is now in the loving arms of God. God bless her. Daily News
