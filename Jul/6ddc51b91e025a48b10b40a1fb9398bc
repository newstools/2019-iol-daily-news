These evils have the effect of striking terror and sparking panic in society, whereby there is no free zone for ordinary people to live in peace. People are afraid to send children to school, terrified to use public transport to work, or even to stay alone in what should be the sanctity of their own homes. The big question on everybody’s lips is: “Who will be the next to be murdered or robbed?” This raises vital questions about the inability of our national and provincial governments, municipal structures and law enforcement agencies to protect ordinary people, including the most vulnerable women and children. Our leaders have become deaf to the cries of our people; they have become so embroiled in pursuing their own agendas and aspirations that this is blinding them from seeing the tears of innocent citizens who become victims of crime. When will they stand up and take responsibility for this sorry state of affairs? When will our people regain trust in leaders who cannot see or hear? When will we be able to live in peace and safety?
