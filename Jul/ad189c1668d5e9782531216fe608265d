Durban- Sentencing for the Durban serial rapist Moses Mavila has been postponed until next month. Mavila, who appeared at the Pinetown Magistrates Court today had pleaded guilty to more than 60 cases of robbery and rape earlier this year. He was dubbed the "highway rapist"Â  for his modus operandi of luring women with the promise of jobs and raping them and then robbing them. He conducted his activities on the M19 in the city between 2014 and 2019 until he was arrested in February this month. The reason for the postponement was that the presiding magistrate Bilkish Asmal was not present due to ill health. In a packed courtroom, many victims were left disappointed by the news of the latest postponement as the matter had also been postponed last week. The matter had also been attended by members of the Democratic Alliance and its women's network (DAWN) who had come out in support of the victims and wanting justice to be served. A group of women who were in support of the victims were singing and dancing and demanding justice for the victims. Mavila complained that he was tired of the postponements. "I am tired of these postponements," he told his Legal Aid attorney Judy Reddy. He is set to come back on August 30. Daily News
