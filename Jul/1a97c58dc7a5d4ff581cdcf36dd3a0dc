Durban - The bail application of the man accused of murdering a 22-year-old woman whose body was found in an abandoned building in Verualm  was postponed until Friday. Fiso Mthembu stands accused of murdering Komell Pillay whose body was discovered at Brake village in Verulam. State prosecutor Winnie Mlangeni asked for the postponement of the matter to verify  Mthembu's address and he has to point it out as he was not sure. Legal Aid lawyer Quintal Penniston agreed to the postponement and said the investigating officer to go with her client. The Daily News has previously reported that Pillay's body was found at a building in Brake village. Pillay also known as Delicia had left with a friend to go out the previous night.  In a seperate matter, the case of five men who are accused of murdering former naval officer Seelan Pillay was moved to September. Two Phoenix police officers, Theagen Naidoo and Triston Pillay, and three brothers Anben and Sugendran and Sathasiven Reddy were previously denied bail for the murder of Pillay. He was killed because he allegedly stole a grass cutting machine. He was burned to death in an alleged altercation with the men. The bail denial had come as a huge shock to members of the accused's family. Daily News
