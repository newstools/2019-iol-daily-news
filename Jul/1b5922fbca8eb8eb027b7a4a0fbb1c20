OPINION - Like Stuart Hess, I, too, keep thinking back to the Cricket World Cup Final of over a week ago (Imagine if it wasnâ€™t the Black Caps, Daily News, July 18). And again, like Hess, I am struck by the good grace, humility and sportsmanship displayed by New Zealand and their captain, Kane Williamson, after their unfortunate loss to England. Some might argue that New Zealand were robbed of a maiden World Cup championship, justifiably citing umpiring errors which went against them. But listening to Kane, you would not think so. I also tip my hat to England star Ben Stokes, who had apparently asked the umpires to deduct four runs credited to his team after the ball deflected off his bat and ran to the boundary. This is sportsmanship of the highest order, an excellent example for youngsters to follow. I agree with Hess that not many other nations would have accepted the result as easily as New Zealand did.
