Despite our government’s best efforts, including using residents’ associations and volunteers to prevent pollution of rivers, streams and wetlands, our water sources continue to be heavily polluted. Water is a basic resource that guarantees life for all living things on the planet. However, its scarcity, exacerbated by pollution, causes millions of people to have poor access to this much-needed resource. It’s time that we work together to prevent water pollution. Reducing our plastic consumption and reusing when we can, properly disposing of chemical cleaners, oil and non-biodegradable items to keep them from ending up down the drains, will save our water. As we celebrate Mandela Month, the Department of Water and Sanitation calls on all people to dedicate their 67 minutes of goodwill towards cleaning up rivers, streams, wetlands, dams, canals and any other freshwater sources. One of the most effective ways to stand up for our precious water resource is to speak out in support of clean water and participate in cleaning the river next to you.
