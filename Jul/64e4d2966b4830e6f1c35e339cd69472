Recently I took a disabled person to the hospital and on arrival discovered all of the public parking and disabled bays were occupied. Furthermore, there were also many taxis using the public parking bays. I was compelled to park on the pavement, taking care not to block pedestrians as the walkway is very wide. Having finished at the hospital, I discovered a parking fine on my vehicle. I spoke to the metro officer and pointed out the number of taxis using public parking bays in the vicinity of the hospital. I also pointed out that this parking area was not a designated taxi rank, but the officer was more concerned about space for the taxis to park. It is becoming increasingly frustrating for motorists to travel on our roads and to use public parking bays on our streets due to the menacing taxis. Furthermore, it appears that some metro officers seem to think it is more important to place the needs of the taxis above those of ordinary motorists. Nearly every street has become a taxi rank in our city. F Khader Redhill
