While Wabantu strutted her stuff in what has been described as a ‘barely there’ crystal encrusted mesh dress designed to make her sparkle under this year's VDJ theme “Stars of Africa”, Khanyase had people talking about her outfit - or lack of it - as it had been painted on by her artist brother, Simphiwe. With only a G-string to keep out the cold, Khanyase’s outfit at the front depicted an African tree against a golden backdrop. That along with a pair of eyes etched onto her buttocks saw many punters distracted from their race cards as she sauntered past. While she was pleased with the attention, Khanyase said she was unhappy with members of the public trying to touch her as she made her way to her marquee. Speaking to Independent on Saturday, Khanyase said she wanted to take the “crown” from controversial Wabantu, whose rise to fame at came on the back of a little black number she wore to the 2017 VDJ which slit was much more revealing than expected.
