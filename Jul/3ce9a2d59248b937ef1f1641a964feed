Durban - Student protest broke out at the University of KwaZulu-Natal's Howard College and Westville campuses on Tuesday. Ashton Bodrick, Executive Director of corporate relations, said students are engaged in protest action on the Westville and Howard College Campuses. "However, there were reports of students clashing with security on both Howard College and Westville Campuses. Management continues to engage the student leadership to address concerns raised by the students.  Risk Management Services and SAPS are present on campus,"Bodrick said. In videos that were recorded on cellphones and shared on social media a group of people with part of their faces covered by scarves threw rocks at a private security company at the UKZN Westville Campus. The protests are linked to funding which has resulted in academic exclusion for certain students. On Monday protests erupted at the Durban University of Technology in Steve Biko (Mansfield)Road.
