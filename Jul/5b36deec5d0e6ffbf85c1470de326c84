Durban - Emergency services are attending to two men who sustained moderate injuries when their boat capsized near Isipingo main beach on Monday. Garrith Jamieson, a spokesperson for Rescue Care paramedics, said both men are being treated on the shoreline before they will be transported, by ambulance, to a local hospital. Jamieson said they were still determining what caused the boat to capsize. On Saturday, the National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI) Rocky Bay duty crew were activated following reports of a boat that capsized in the surfline at Mtwalume near Margate south of Durban. Kevin Fourie, NSRI Rocky Bay station commander, said five people were rescued from the surf just after 11 am.    "Our NSRI rescue swimmers, Medevac ambulance services, Lifeguards and Police Search and Rescue responded. On arrival on the scene all five men had been rescued safely by a fellow private boat seine netter. The crew were safe ashore. The crew of the seine netters had righted and recovered the casualty boat,"he said. Fourie said paramedics treated three of the five casualty crew for minor injuries and no further assistance was required. The crew of Seine Netter were commended for their swift action. Daily News
