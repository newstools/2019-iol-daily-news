Also in the taxmanâ€™s sights are some tobacco companies, which are thought to be declaring only a portion of the billions they make. And Malema has admitted receiving a loan of R1 million from the owners of these companies, while they also contributed to the establishment of the party. It is no wonder that Malema and his cohorts are so determined in their pursuit of Pravin Gordhan, the former Sars commissioner under whose watch Malema was prosecuted for tax evasion. Malema is still smarting from losing his farm and house, both of which were seized and auctioned to pay his tax debts. F THOMAS Durban Daily News
