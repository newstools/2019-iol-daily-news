Williams’s Bafana Bafana debut five years ago was not impressive; he conceded five goals in a hammering by Brazil in a friendly outing in 2014. He then became the joke of the town. But he did not despair; he continued with the hard work, and today the SuperSport United shot-stopper is the undisputed Bafana Bafana number one. He was in scintillating form for Bafana Bafana in Egypt, taking everything coming in front of him. I hope our youth can learn from his example that life is not plain sailing all the time; there will be ups and downs, but you must keep grinding away. Williams said when he reacted to his call-up to Bafana Bafana: “I am the only one who can believe in myself. If I am given the opportunity, I need to claim it.” If Williams continues with this type of attitude, I am sure he is destined for bigger things in life. Romanius Zulu Durban Daily News
