Recently residents were are up in arms over constant water leaks that have led to damaged infrastructure in the area. Linzi du Preez, chairperson of the La Lucia Residents Association, said this was a long-running issue. Du Preez said some of the leaks were repaired, only for them to burst again a few weeks later. Former La Lucia councillor Heinz de Boer said this was an old problem, which also affected other areas, like Phoenix and eManzimtoti. He said the problem was old infrastructure, like asbestos-cement pipes that were never replaced, and that new plastic pipes were not compatible with the old installations. De Boer said fixing the infrastructure would cost the municipality between R1billion and R2bn. Daily News
