KZN Grounds Operations Manager Mortas Khambule said: "Last week weather conditions were a lot better that previous weeks, yet we also saw peak days such as Thursday and Friday." He said most of the Working on Fire teams will stop conducting fire breaks and block burns by July 31 because the province would be approaching the windy month of August where teams will be on standby for any possible fire call-outs. “In previous years we've recorded more fires in the month of August than any other month during a winter fire season, we expect high wind speed which if very favorable to wildfires,” Khambule said. He said it was important for landowners check the Fire Danger Index (FDI)  issued by the SA Weather Service. Daily News
