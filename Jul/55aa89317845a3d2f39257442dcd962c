Durban - The KZN MEC for Transport, Community Safety and Liaison, Mxolisi Kaunda, said he was concerned about suspended infrastructure projects in the province because of contractual issues. The MEC was delivering his budget speech in the KZN Legislature in Pietermaritzburg on Tuesday. Kaunda said the performance of some contractors in the infrastructure industry was affecting both established and emerging contractors. “Currently, we have 28 projects that have been suspended because of defaulting by contractors,” Kaunda said. He said some of the reasons behind the suspension was believed to be the global economic climate, high rise in the cost of living and corporate greediness, wherein one contractor has more than five projects at once. “We are considering serious penalties to those who are abandoning our projects deliberately,” he said. “Equally, the department will improve its Financial Risk Management Assessment of all contractors awarded work. We have now commissioned a technical investigation into the causes of this problem.” He said at the end of September 2019, they would host the Provincial Transport Contractor Indaba which would address the issue with role players in the construction sector.
