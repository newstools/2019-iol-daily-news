The Daily News spoke to award- winning Durban-born film producer Anant Singh, who felt that Durban was the biggest creative hub for all of the creative industries, not just film. “While a film will profile the locations of the city, a film production also makes a significant contribution to the economy of the city by creating employment opportunities in a range of related industries, including hotels and hospitality, catering, car hire, carpentry and manufacturing,” he said. According to a Deloitte study, for every R1 spent on a film production, the economic impact is three times that amount. Singh said that the involvement of local communities was essential as it brought a level of support and local knowledge important to the smooth running of film productions. “Having a film-friendly community makes a production less challenging. Local communities are proud to play hosts to productions, as they benefit sometimes as extras in the film. We’ve seen this with films and series like Imbewu, where we’ve used so many local actors who had never been in front of the camera before,” he said. Meanwhile, Lwazi Duma, 27, an amateur film-maker from uMzinto who filmed his feature film Struck Blind with a Digital SLR camera in the city centre, has been selected to screen his film at the festival.
