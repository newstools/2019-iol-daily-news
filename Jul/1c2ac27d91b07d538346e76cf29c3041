Durban - At the time of his death on Monday, Sam Meyiwa - the father of slain footballer Senzo Meyiwa whose murder nearly five years ago still remains unsolved - had seen the backs of three police commissioners and two police ministers who had each promised that his son's killers would be brought to book. Senzo, who rose to national fame first as a goalkeeper for Orlando Pirates and would go on to represent the national team, Bafana Bafana, was killed during an apparent robbery at his musician girlfriend, Kelly Khumalo's home in 2014. There were six adults in the family home when Meyiwa died, including Khumalo, her mother, sister Zandi, two children, Meyiwa’s friend Tumelo Madlala and Longwe Twala, who was dating Zandi at the time Zanokuhle Mbatha was arrested five days after the shooting and appeared in court. He was freed on 11 November due to a lack of evidence and is now suing the police for R17m for wrongful arrest. Nearly five years after his son was killed here are some promised made were made that he never got to see:   He said at the time: "It is one of my priorities to crack this case with the team. I’m very positive we’ll make arrests but I don’t want to tip them (the killers) off by divulging the plans we are going to use. Discussing our strategy we will give them ideas to evade arrest." Meyiwa's father, Sam had placed his hopes on Mbalula saying he was confident that his son's murder would be solved because Mbalula was young and energetic.                   Daily News
