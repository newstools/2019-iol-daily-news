World leaders should be appalled and sickened by the cruel practices of the Trump administration toward immigrants seeking safety, freedom and a future in the US. There has been almost no effort to reunite parents with children who were taken from them. In some cases, parents were deported, but without their children. Those mothers and fathers have no idea where their children are, or if they will ever see them again. Separating children from their parents is both cruel and immoral. This is a crime against humanity. Trump’s immigration policy has been characterised by unnecessary detention and inadequate monitoring that has allowed for abuses at detention centres - including sexual assaults and forced medication of children. These are the actions of a dictator, not a US president. Americans must demand and insist that their president’s brutal and cruel policies not only stop, but are reversed. Those harmed must be helped, not ignored. Stop the hatred, bigotry and bullying. E Peek Glenwood Daily News
