The gangster behaviour of mayor Zandile Gumede’s supporters in tackling city manager Sipho Nzuza for apparently turning State’s witness against her bares this out. Far from being bastions of democracy, the ANC officials prove themselves again and again to be nothing more than cut-throat gangsters intent on getting rid of anyone who stands in the way of their fraudulent, corrupt deal-making. Far too many municipal officials have been gunned down in this province for not toeing the line and ensuring that contracts go - corruptly - in the right direction, and far too few of their killers have been brought to justice. Increase security around both Peer and Nzuza, and ensure that Nzuza lives to tell his tale in court. V NAIDOO Durban Daily News
