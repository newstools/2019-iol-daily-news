If politicians are committing such criminal acts, how will they ensure good governance, rule of law, accountability and improve service delivery, especially in rural areas? The protests we are witnessing across the country are a matter of great concern. Citizens are tired of promises and want to see an improved quality of life for all. Meticulous political management is crucial to improved municipal service delivery, which is also a constitutional obligation. Efforts to improve life for people must look beyond free and fair elections. Deployment of councillors should not just be based on “Struggle credentials” and political patronage, but should be based on merit, as this will help municipalities work more efficiently and better for their citizens. The financial sustainability of municipalities across South Africa lies in honest, accountable and service-oriented public servants. MOHAMED SAEED Pietermaritzburg Daily News
