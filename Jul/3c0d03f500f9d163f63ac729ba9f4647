This follows two recent incidents in which bottles were thrown at vehicles. Police spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala said Westville police were investigating a case of malicious damage to property after a motorist’s car was damaged along the M13 on Sunday. The motorist was travelling on the M13 eastbound at 5.45pm when he noticed a bucket rolling on the road. He swerved to avoid it and saw a man standing at the roadside. Then he heard a big bang on his left front door. “His vehicle sustained damage on the left door,” Gwala said. Gwala said Cato Manor police were also investigating a case of malicious damage to property after a man’s car was damaged while travelling on Booth Road under the bridge on the N2 on June 23. Gwala said the man had noticed a group of people on the bridge. “He heard a loud bang on the windscreen, lost control of his vehicle and hit bricks and stones on the side of the road. The windscreen, right fender and tyre were damaged,” she said. A WhatsApp message has warned motorists to take care. “Use caution when travelling and be aware of what is happening around you. If your vehicle is targeted, proceed to a safe, well lit and busy area before stopping to check damages.” Daily News
