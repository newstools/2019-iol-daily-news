When so many others in the party continued to vote to keep Jacob Zuma as president of the country, Hanekom was among the few who voted with their conscience in a vote of no confidence. We can only imagine that those who continued supporting Zuma had vested interests, which informed their votes. They must now live with the knowledge that their actions contributed to the lengthening of the “nine wasted years” the country endured under Zuma, and whose effects are still being felt even though he is no longer in power. I fear that the economic impact of the sheer pillaging which characterised the Zuma years will take years more to undo, and salute people like Hanekom who tried to do the right thing, even at risk to themselves.
