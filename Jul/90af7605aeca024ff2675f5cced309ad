Durban - A 48-year-old woman was found dead with multiple stab wounds inside her vehicle at the corner of Riverdene and Butterfly Roads in Newlands West, Durban on Monday. Details on the incident and the motive are still sketchy. A case of murder was opened at Newlands East police station for investigation said KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala. Democratic Alliance PR Councillor ward 11 and 37 ShontelÂ De Boer said something serious needs to be done about the Newlands SAPS in order to improve service. She said this is necessary to ensure the community sees the police as a strong force who will serve and protect them. "This is tragic. The area has become quite dangerous and it seems to be getting worse over time. The crime is escalating quite rapidly and the police are not doing enough to ensure the safety of the community. I understand that manpower is a problem but the service residents receive is really bad that many people do not even report some crime to the station,"she said. Daily News
