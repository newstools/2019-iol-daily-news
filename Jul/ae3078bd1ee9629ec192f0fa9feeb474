Durban - A security guard, belonging to a private company, was ambushed and robbed of his firearm when he attended to an alarm activation in Hillcrest on Sunday. Captain Nqobile Gwala, a KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson, said It is alleged that at 15:30, a security official responded to an alarm in one of the houses on Highlands Road when he noticed two suspects at the premises. "He approached the said suspects when a third one came from behind and overpowered him. They robbed him of his firearm with ammunition,"Gwala said. Charges of attempted burglary and robbery are being investigated by Hillcrest SAPS. The incident has arisen a day before the United Nations #GunDestructionDay. Gun Free SA called for destruction of guns in the country. The 9th of July was declared by the UN as #GunDestructionDay, making it the official date for destruction of small arms worldwide. In the past decade global gun stocks have increased, fuelling crime, conflict, gender-based violence, forced migration and more. Daily News
