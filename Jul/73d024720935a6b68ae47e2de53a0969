Durban - Charges of defeating the ends of justice, dealing in drugs and theft had been withdrawn in the Durban Magistrates Court against two Sydenham Policemen on Tuesday. Captain Alvin Peters and Constable Gavais Heslop were charged, in January, after police claimed to have found 3 000 capsules of heroin in their possession during a sting operation. Both Peters and Heslop were granted R30 000 bail on condition that they reported to the Organised Crime Unit based in the city centre once a week. Both men directed media queries to their attorney Reeves Parsee. He said all charges were withdrawn in the Durban Magistrates Court. Parsee said the state had not provided a reason for the withdrawal. Both Peters and Heslop said their names were tarnished and their reputations suffered after being arrested. The policemen's previous Attorney Anand Nepaul described Peters as an officer with no pending cases or convictions against him. Nepaul said while Heslop also had no pending cases against him and no previous convictions, he had been involved in a shooting in 2016. However, he was not charged in connection with the incident.
