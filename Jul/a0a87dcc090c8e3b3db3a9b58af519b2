Durban - Cappuccino is a young African penguin which was recently found on the beach by a local resident before it made its way to uShaka Sea World. According to the South African Association for Marine Biological Research (Saambr), Cappuccino did not have external injuries and appeared to have been in good condition. Although she was weak, tired, thin and dehydrated, she can be treated. “It appears that Cappuccino lost her way and spent such a long time at sea without food or rest that she could no longer remain out at sea,” Saambr said. The association said Cappuccino was resting in a specially designed enclosure at uShaka Sea World’s veterinary hospital, where she will remain for another week or two while she regained her strength. “It’s always a good sign when stranded penguins show signs of hunger and an eagerness to eat the food that is offered,” Saambr said. The penguin had started eating sardine tails which was almost a record for a young stranded penguin in her condition. “Watching this small, four month old penguin eat with such gusto offers great hope that she will fully recover. Hopefully, within a few months, she will be flown to Port Elizabeth to join the penguins at the Southern African Foundation for the Conservation of Coastal Birds (Sanccob) being prepared for release,” Saambr said.
