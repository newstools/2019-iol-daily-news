Durban - Contractors are working flat out to reopen the damaged portion of Higginson Highway, in Chatsworth, to traffic. In April, an underground stormwater culvert  which travels from the Chatsworth Stadium, under the Higginson highway, then towards the Bottlebrush Informal settlement was damaged. The culvert had moved and began filling with water. This resulted in the road surface to collapse above it and eventually engineers closed the arterial route to Durban between Moorton and Croftdene. This caused traffic congestion within the suburbs as motorists had to use alternative routes to exit from Chatsworth. On Thursday, Previn Vedan, eThekwini ward 71 councillor, said he spoke with the site manager who informed him that most of the back filling has been completed. "The contractor is awaiting test results, from testing which was submitted today.  Once the results come back, and if positive, two layers will be added to the backfill and thereafter tar will be added and the roadway will be reopened.  The estimated time of completion remains the end of July,"Vedan said. EThekwini municipality spokesperson Msawakhe Mayisela explained that the culvert under the highway had structural failure. "Structural work on the culvert was undertaken. A few informal settlements that are on the road verge were relocated. The estimated costs of the repairs is R6.5 million,"Mayisela said. Daily News
