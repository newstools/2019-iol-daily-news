One of the most common arguments I’ve heard is “we’re providing work for our brothers and sisters”. If that were true, there’d be little or no litter lying around. Everywhere you go there’s this unsightly littering and disrespect for our environment. The majority of this litter, aside from the broken glass, is the packaging from fast food outlets. The municipality doesn’t care take a walk around the city and you will get a very clear picture as to why Durban is known as “Dirt Bin”. No one seems to care. To some of us, it’s unimaginable to even contemplate disposing of anything by unashamedly dropping it on the ground. What is also remarkable is that most people who litter probably wouldn’t dream of doing that in their own homes and on their properties. This is our communal environment, and we should respect it for many reasons, but most importantly because we all share it. Keep your litter with you until you can dispose of it in a bin or at home. Please don’t throw it on the ground. Marcel Wichura Hillcrest Daily News
