Durban - Police are probing whether a syndicate could be targetting Mercedes Benz motor vehicles in Durban. Three of them were stolen in the past 24 hours. Two of them were taken during the course of house robberies while a third was hijacked. In an incident at 5am on Friday, Colonel Thembeka Mbele, a KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson said the complainant was asleep at their home in  Redberry Park in Phoenix when he heard a noise and went to investigate. "Upon investigation he was confronted by two armed men who robbed them of cash, jewellery, cellphones and fled with the complainant's vehicle," Mbele said. A case of robbery was opened at Phoenix police station for investigation. The Phoenix Crime and Community Assist (PCCA) group said a Mercedes Benz was allegedly taken during a house robbery in Starwood on Thursday morning.   Ethekwini Secure reported that in Marigold Road, Asherville a motorist was allegedly hijacked of his silver Mercedes Benz on Thursday night. A police source said for now it was mere speculation if someone had placed Mercedes Benz cars on the list to steal. However if the cases were combined and investigated by a specialised unit there could be a pattern. Daily News
