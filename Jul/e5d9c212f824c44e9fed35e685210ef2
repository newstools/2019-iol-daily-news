In line with the Thuma Mina spirit, former president Kgalema Motlanthe was spot on when he called on all leaders to be bold and selfless, and to take time to serve their communities through volunteer programmes, without (ab)using public funds. Men and women in leadership are encouraged to follow in the footsteps of our political heroes who dedicated their lives for the betterment of our people. Volunteerism and mentorship programmes, especially in rural schools, would impart a sense of responsibility on the young which will free them from hunger and poverty. If all of us, together with government, business and organised labour, could work together for the prosperity of our country by investing our time and resources to tackle South Africa’s challenges, we can have a good story to tell. I challenge all government entities, the private sector and NGOs to go around and identify crumbling and ill-equipped rural and township schools so they can “regularise” them by conducting educational workshops or free classes on a monthly basis outside calendar events such as Mandela Day. This could have a symbiotic effect in emancipating our people and add impetus to the NDP Vision 2030. Rankepile Khomo Duduza Daily News
