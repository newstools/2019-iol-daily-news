The Freedom Front + thumped the DA in a by-election in Stilfontein in the North West last Wednesday, which was a safe DA ward. The DA beat the FF+ in that ward by over 1000 votes in the last local government elections. The Stilfontein win now gives the FF+ great motivation to challenge the DA in all other wards in the coming by-elections. While it’s a known fact that factionalism is making serious inroads into the body politic of the ANC, it’s also quite obvious that a similar situation exists in the DA. What must be remembered is that the FF+ has made it quite clear that it places a premium on the suitability and merit of a candidate, irrespective of colour, creed or ethnicity - in short, the best man/woman for the job. This policy resonates with most whites, coloureds and Indians, as the FF+ rightly points out that B-BBEE has passed its sell-by date. On the other hand, the DA has endorsed this empowerment policy of race-based opportunities, thus alienating a large majority of its voters. Is this the beginning of the end of the DA?
