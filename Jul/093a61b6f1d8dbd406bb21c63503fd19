It follows that all religions have a duty to promote peace and harmony among all peoples under all circumstances. The contentions of some religions to assert a dress code to draw a distinction between their followers and others is difficult to understand. The wearing of a headscarf is a practice that must be clearly explained to non-Muslims because it is the cause of much confusion and perhaps even animosity among people. Major Fatima Isaacs should explain why it is that her dress code takes priority over her duties to the country. Can she not practise her religion privately? This would allow her beliefs to be of greater worth to her than her present position, which promotes confusion and animosity, rather than peace and harmony, which are among the highest values of religion.
