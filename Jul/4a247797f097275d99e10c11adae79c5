The woman, who cannot be named to protect the identity of her child, made a brief appearance in the Verulam Magistrateâ€™s Court yesterday, a few hundred metres away from where she allegedly dumped her baby. Prosecutor Winnie Mlangeni said the woman did not know the address where she lived, but could point it out. The matter was adjourned for the address to be verified. Legal Aid lawyer Quintal Penniston agreed to the postponement. Earlier this month the Daily News reported that a six-month-old baby girl was found by a restaurant employee in a pathway outside the restaurant in Wick Street, Verulam. A video of the mother dumping the baby did the rounds on social media after a security company got hold of the footage. The company later tracked down the 21-year-old woman, who was arrested as she was about to board a taxi. Social Development MEC Nonhlanhla Khoza condemned the incident and said they would do more to ensure women knew what their options were if they could not care for their children. Daily News
