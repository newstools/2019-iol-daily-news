According to the report, a 75-year-old Clairwood woman is a bundle of nerves after receiving a R3million metro bill from the eThekwini Municipality. DA councillor Sharmaine Sewshanker has stated that she has written to the head of billing to investigate and sort out the senior citizen’s problem immediately. But what concerns me is the lack of action or inability of the DA councillor to assist the lady. A fundamental principle of any party is to fulfil the mandate of service delivery. Local councillors are at the coalface of service delivery. Any councillor worth his/her salt, becoming aware of the plight of the pensioner, would have immediately taken her to the relevant department and ensured that the matter was satisfactorily resolved. Councillor Sewshanker failed to do this. As a former ward councillor, I can state that officials are more prone to act when confronted by complaints than receiving an email. The DA uses every opportunity to tell people how great it is at service delivery - yet it seems incapable of doing simple things that have an impact on people’s lives. Daily News
