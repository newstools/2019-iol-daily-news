The SA National Civic Organisation now calls for a picket outside court in support of her, and calls for all progressive forces to support this Struggle heroine against white supremacists with racist political agendas who try to further racist ideologies by dragging the name of their leader into disrepute. She is a leader who can play a role in “nation-building, and unity and reconciliation”, to quote the SA National Civic Organisation. The continuous bleating by leaders and associations calling for nation-building, while referring to all whites as white supremacists and racists trying to further racist ideologies, does nothing for those ideals the new dawn seeks to inculcate for nation-building. There are laws that govern the treatment of animals, and when a Member of Parliament is accused of animal cruelty, laws must be applied. Our mayor is charged with serious corruption, yet she is supported come hell or high water by her followers, who threaten to trash the city. On the other hand, people trash the city and block areas while protesting the lack of service delivery by the same mayor. I simply don’t understand the people of this country, who are led like sheep by people whose morals and scruples are non-existent. You get the government you deserve. Roland Fisher Durban Daily News
