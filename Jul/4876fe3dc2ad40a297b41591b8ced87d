"Police who were in the vicinity noticed one of the suspects fleeing down Wick Street in the vicinity of a bank. The suspect opened fire on police. The injured officer is in hospital,"Balram said. Cases of robbery and attempted murder were opened at Verulam police station for investigation. Balram noted that Police Minister Bheki Cele wanted to amend the Private Security Industry Regulation Act so that high-calibre weapons can be removed from public spaces and make them safer. The draft proposals to the PSIRA would limit security companiesâ€™ use of such weapons. Armed response teams would be able to use only shotguns or handguns. Use of semi-automatic weapons would be allowed only in the transportation of cash or assets. Daily News
