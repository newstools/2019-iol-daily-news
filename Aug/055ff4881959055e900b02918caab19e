The business chamber will now be known as the Pietermaritzburg Midlands Chamber of Business. Chief executive Melanie Veness said a number of reasons influenced the decision to change the name: one was because they had a number of members beyond Maritzburg, and another was because there were no chambers representing people in the surrounding areas. “So in order to properly represent what is stated in our Memorandum Of Incorporation, to be able to serve the wider community and to be relevant to them we’ve expanded and are now the Pietermaritzburg Midlands Chamber of Business,” Veness explained. She said the decision to change the name was finalised at an annual meeting on July 25. She added that the name change would be included on their documentation, followed by a change in logo which they were currently getting feedback on. Veness said because they were city-based, they only focused on commerce and industry, but now they had taken on two more pillars. “Essentially, the strategy changes. We haven’t actively looked for members outside the borders of Pietermaritzburg, which we will do now. Second, now that we include the Midlands, our strategic divisioning will be looking at four pillars: commerce, industry, agriculture, and tourism.” There is to be an official launch once everything was finalised.
