She is innocent until proven guilty. Gumedeâ€™s ascendence in the ANC to the chair of the eThekwini region was controversial from the start. It divided the party down to the branches and she was finally able to win a conference boycotted by most branches. When Gumede was elected chairperson, she brought with her a leadership team of mainly of incompetent and inexperienced people. Their appointments were based on their blind support for Gumede. The same happened when she was appointed mayor. She used her position to settle scores by removing experienced comrades. Gumede failed to unite the organisation and the last election results point to a party in serious decline. With just 54% of the vote (down from over 60%), the ANC risks losing the forthcoming local elections. Membership in this region is also at an all-time low, as more members leave because of the infighting and greed for positions. Gumede had a responsibility to unite the movement, grow its membership, ensure that the municipality delivers to its citizens. She failed in all of these and her recall was necessary.
