Durban - A teenage boy was left dead and another was left injured following a hit and run in Henley Dam, west of Pietermaritzburg. Both boys are believed to be 17-years-old. ER24 paramedics responded to the scene on Edendale Road at 2pm on Sunday afternoon to find another emergency service company already in attendance. Russel Meiring, ER24 spokesperson said paramedics found the two teenagers lying down a small embankment a distance away from the road. “Medics assessed the patients and found that one boy had sustained numerous injuries and showed no signs of life. Unfortunately, nothing could be done for him and he was declared dead,” Meiring said. “The second boy was assessed and found to have sustained moderate injuries. He was treated and thereafter transported to hospital by another service.” He said the vehicle which ran over the teenagers was not found at the scene. He said police were on scene and were investigating. Daily News
