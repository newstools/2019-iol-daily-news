The reason is that they believe she has an unfair advantage every time she takes to the track, thus nullifying their chances of obtaining a first place. In most other races such as the 100m and 200m, the finishes are exciting and unpredictable, with split seconds separating first and second place. In Semenya’s races, she beats the field by 30m to 40m - predictable, boring and frustrating for the rest of the field who know they stand no chance of winning. Nor does it excite the spectators. They want to see strong and fair competition. I’m surprised that women athletes have not boycotted some of her races, but then again, athletics is a professional sport and money talks. Second place is better than nothing. Semenya speaks of “these rude responses in terms of me competing against them”, which just emphasises the fact that they are not happy competing against her. She has some tough decisions to make. John Whitlock Germiston Daily News
