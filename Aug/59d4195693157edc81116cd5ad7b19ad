The kidnappers had demanded money via WhatsApp. The body of a Ghanaian national, known as Sakha, was found in a field in Camperdown, north-west of Durban, on Monday. Sakha was kidnapped in July, near his home in Chatsworth. His family was contacted by the kidnappers, demanding R15000. “The kidnappers contacted us and told us that our brother owed them - they wanted money so they could release him. They wanted R15000 and we told them we didn’t have that much. Then we sent them R2000. After we gave them the money, they switched off the phone,” said a relative, who would not be named. After two months of investigations, Chatsworth police arrested a 28-year-old woman for her involvement in the kidnapping last week. She appeared in the Chatsworth Magistrate’s Court on Monday and was remanded until next Monday, said Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane. “Two suspects were also arrested in Hammarsdale on Monday night. Police recovered a licensed firearm with ammunition, as well as a vehicle suspected to be used during the kidnapping,” Zwane said. Daily News
