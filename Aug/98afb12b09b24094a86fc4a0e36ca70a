Durban - The ANC KZN leadership's announcement of its Mayoral candidates for various provincial municipalities including eThekwini (Durban) and Mgungundlovu (Pietermaritzburg) has been delayed. The provincial office has called a media briefing for 11.30am on Thursday. However, after over an hour waiting for the briefing to start, party provincial spokesperson Ricardo Mthembu addressed the media apologising for the delay. "We apologise for the unforeseen delay. It's just that we are finalising a few municipalities hence the apology. We propose that the briefing to start at 1 pm," Mthembu said. ThursdayÂ  is the ANCs deadline to announce the party's candidates for the replacement of Mayors and their deputies in various troubled municipalities. It is still not clear who will replace the former eThekwini Mayor Zandile Gumede and her deputy Fawzia Peer. The city's ANC executive committee members were fired seven days ago following after numerous meetings by the party leadership trying to deal with the fact that Gumede is facing criminal charges in connection to alleged fraud and corruption. She was initially sent on a leave of absence for a month, which had since been extended by another month. Her supporters' protest against the move was seen by many as one of the reasons for the decision to fire all the ANC councillors. * The story is developing. Daily News
