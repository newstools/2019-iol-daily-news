The police officer immediately responded and the suspects were pointed out by the guard. The men were instructed to stop but they jumped over the fence and pointed a gun at the police officer.  A shot was fired and struck one of the men. The others fled. One of them grabbed their accomplice’s firearm. The wounded man was taken to hospital where he is under police guard,"Zwane said. Daily News
