They are expected to appear in the Pinetown Magistrates Court on Monday. According to Durban Metro police spokesperson Senior Superintendent Parboo Sewpersad said members of their drugs task team received information about drug dealing in McDonald’s car park in Pinetown. The dealer allegedly worked with the SAPS detectives and VIP Unit officer to abduct the source of the information to extort money from him. Failing to get money from the source, they looked for another victim and approached men in Union Lane in Pinetown, and attempted to extort money from them. But these were undercover metro police officers, and the three men were arrested, Sewpersad said. One was a sergeant from the Chatsworth detective service charged with extortion, kidnapping, and possession of a firearm while under the influence of alcohol; the second was a warrant officer from the SAPS Pinetown, charged with extortion and kidnapping; while the VIP unit member was charged with possession of a dangerous weapon, extortion and kidnapping. They recovered a service pistol with one magazine and 16 rounds, a Z88 service pistol with one magazine and six rounds, Glock gas pistol, and a CZ 75 gas pistol from the policemen’s SAPS vehicle.
