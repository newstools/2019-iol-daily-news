Durban - A 75-year-old Phoenix resident was stabbed on his hand when he confronted a burglar inside his lounge on Tuesday. The resident of Palmview was in his back yard when a burglar climbed over the front gate and walked into the home through an unlocked kitchen gate just after 7 am. Annastashia Naidu, of private security company Platinum Assest Protection, said the burglar had taken several items and put them into a plastic packet. These included items from the lounge and consisted of mainly brassware. "The resident walked into the lounge where he came face to face with the burglar. He was in a state of shock. It is unclear if the resident and the burglar had a scuffle when he was stabbed on his hand,"she said. The burglar is alleged to have fled without taking anything. The resident had driven himself to a local hospital for medical treatment. Naidu said the resident was shaken up by the ordeal. "A description of the burglar was given and despite a lengthy search of the area he could not be found. The area is being hit by petty crime because many of the criminals are using river crossing to make their escape.Â  We urge residents to be more vigilant. The resident has not opened a case as yet to the Phoenix police station. Daily News
