Durban -  The minister of Education in KwaZulu-Natal has ordered an urgent investigation to find out who is the perpetrator behind an apparent act of racism at Ladysmith High School. A video, purportedly to have been filmed at Ladysmith High School, in northern KZN, has sparked outrage. In the short clip, a pupil is seen walking out of the boys toilet. He appears to be upset. The person recording the video continues to walk into the toilet where the offensive words, "F**k Blacks" are written in bold letters on the wall in one of the toilet stalls. Kwazi Mshengu, KZN Education MEC, said the school was in hot water since the incident has since gone viral on social media. "We view this incident in a serious light. Schools are not only factories of knowledge of production but are centres when we produce future leaders and upstanding members of society. Schools are also places where we seek to inculcate values of racial solidarity and social cohesion," Mshengu said. “Such racial characterization and derogatory depiction of other races is an antithesis to our agenda to build a united South Africa,"he added. Mshengu has instructed the Head of Department to work with the School Governing Body and the school principal to investigate the incident and report back to him within a week. Daily News
