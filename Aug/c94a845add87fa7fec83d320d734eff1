A Blue Security officer was sent to the scene in Haycroft Road. Spokesperson Andreas Mathios said the officer found that a dog had picked up what appeared to be a human hand from the bushes. “Detectives from the Phoenix SAPS responded and took over the scene. Police are now searching the area for a body,” Mathios said. He asked residents with information to assist the police. Ward 49 councillor Danovan Pillay said he was aware that a dog had found a hand. “Authorities are looking in the DMOSS area if there is a body, but nothing has been found yet,” he said. “The problem is that whoonga addicts are living there, so it’s not easy to go in there.” Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said the police were investigating the incident. “A K9 member was called to the scene and tried to locate the body, with negative results,” Zwane said. Merlene Pillay said residents had initially thought the dog was carrying a doll’s arm, or the arm of a monkey. “It’s scary. It doesn’t look like an adult’s hand; it’s quite small,” she said.
