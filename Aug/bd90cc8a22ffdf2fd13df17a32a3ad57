Despite efforts by Prasa, which owns the building, to get all taps in the toilets running, there are now only two working taps. According to Prasa spokesperson Zama Nomnganga, the toilets were repaired at the end of March and had since been vandalised. “All the taps in the men’s toilets have been stolen, and one cubicle there has been broken. Three toilets are now not flushing in the female toilets, taps are loose on the wall and some door indicators have been stolen,” he said. Nomnganga said a plumber was working on these faults, which would be repaired soon. “This does not, however, guarantee that the toilets will be in working condition for long, because there is constant vandalism and theft from these toilets,” she said.
