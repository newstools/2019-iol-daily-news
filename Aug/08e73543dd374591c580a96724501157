Considering that South Africa has so many challenges, we have people from a certain section of our community who seem to be obsessed with events in the Middle East and in other non-Muslim countries. Yet their silence on Muslim-on-Muslim violence is deafening. Thousands of innocent civilians have been killed and are still being targeted in terrorist attacks by Muslim extremists, yet there is hardly any condemnation by Muslims. While it’s understandable that Muslims in South Africa adopt a point of view that is essentially pro-Muslim in nature, they should not lose sight of what their brothers are doing elsewhere in the world. It’s time that South African Muslims offered their time and energy to address the myriad problems that manifest themselves in our country. As the saying goes, charity begins at home.
