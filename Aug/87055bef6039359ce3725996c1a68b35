Durban - Pupils from Spearman Road Primary School in Sydenham were expected to return to school on Wednesday after they were told to spend the week at home because the toilets were broken. Late Tuesday afternoon, a WhatsApp status message informed parents that the toilets had been fixed. This, after broken toilets forcing the school to send children home. Only a few pupils were at the school on Tuesday, playing basketball. The principal said the Grade 7s had been at school on Monday, and others yesterday, because they were going on a school trip. Classes would resume today, he added. However, a letter sent to parents last Friday, stated that the school would be closed all this week “on account of toilets not working”. It said pupils were expected to return to school on August 26. They were encouraged to study at home during the week, the letter said. Education department spokesperson Kwazi Mthethwa said school toilets were a countrywide issue. He said he hoped the school would resolve the issue quickly. He said some principals closed schools, but others did not if they had an alternative. He said a school could not function without working toilets. “We acknowledge pupils are losing learning hours, but it’s all about sanitation, which is in the Constitution. “People should have access to proper sanitation,” he said.
