Durban - A seal stranded between Shakas Rock and Catfish Beach on the North Coast KwaZulu-Natal was successfully captured and relocated by members of the Ballito National Sea Rescue Institute(NSRI) at the weekend NSRI spokesperson, Craig Lambinon, said the seal was among members of the public on Saturday and appeared to be stranded on the beach. He said the decision was taken to move the seal to a remote beach far away from any public interference. “The operation was carried out successfully without incident and once released the seal swam off and no further assistance was required,” said Lambinon.
