Yangaphi was at King Shaka Airport police station instead of Tongaat police station, from where she was to be transported to court. She eventually arrived at court at about 11.30am, but her case could not proceed because of the unavailability of an isiXhosa interpreter. The matter was adjourned to Monday. The 36-year-old was arrested on July 27 after arriving at King Shaka International Airport on an Emirates flight from Dubai. Yangaphiâ€™s luggage was searched by police, who found liquid cocaine with an estimated street value of R4million. It was hidden in a shampoo bottle. She was arrested and charged with dealing in drugs and possession of cocaine. Reports said this was the second major cocaine bust of the year after R720m worth of the narcotic was confiscated from the docks in Port Elizabeth in January. The bust netted 706kg of the drug, packed into 1kg bags, said to be concealed under containers on a ship. Daily News
