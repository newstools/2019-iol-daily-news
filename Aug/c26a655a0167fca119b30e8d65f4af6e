Durban - The bail application by the man accused of murdering Durban pastor and actor Mhlonishwa Sakhile Langa could not be concluded on Wednesday because police could not confirm whether he lived at the address he had provided. Jabulani Mthethwa, 55, who has been in custody since his arrest in July, was taken to a shack in Cato Crest, Mayville, where he claimed he lived with his wife and five children. But this could not be confirmed. When police arrived at the home, they were told he had last been seen there five months ago. Magistrate Vanitha Armu adjourned the matter to August 22 to allow the police to obtain a sworn affidavit to confirm this. Mthethwa is facing charges of murder, robbery with aggravating circumstances, and possession of an illegal firearm and ammunition. He was arrested by members of the public after a robbery at a supermarket in the South Beach area on July 14. It is alleged Mthethwa and two other accomplices, who are still at large, were fleeing from the robbery scene when Langa intervened to prevent their escape. Mthethwa allegedly shot Langa once in the chest; he died in hospital. Daily News
