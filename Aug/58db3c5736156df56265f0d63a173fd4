Constable Nkosi Ncwane, 30, who responded to the scene, was arrested after he allegedly did not open a case and towed the vehicle and told the vehicle owner to pay him R7000 in cash for him to release the vehicle. An investigation was conducted on Monday by police officers which led to Ncwane’s arrest in the Durban CBD on Tuesday evening. He was allegedly in possession of two cellphones as well as the money he had solicited. He is facing a charge of corruption. When he appeared in court yesterday, Ncwane told the court that he had been a police officer for eight years and had been living in Inanda for the past two years. He had offered to pay bail of R1000, but magistrate Vanitha Armu said that due to the seriousness of the offence, bail would be set at R2 000. Police spokesperson Thembeka Mbele commended the community for bringing such corrupt practices to the attention of police so that such officers could be brought to book. “There is no place in the SAPS for corrupt police officers,” she said. The matter was adjourned to October 22 for further investigation. Daily News
