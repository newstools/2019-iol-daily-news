I have received my July bill, with estimated charges for both water and lights. I send my readings to the SMS number 30909 without fail every month. This is possible with a calendar reminder, and I have been doing this for the last 20-plus months. My average usage for water is 18Kl, but I have been charged for an estimated usage of 27Kl. How is this possible when the average is about 18Kl? The overcharge for me is just over R500 for water and lights. As a pensioner, where do I find this amount to suddenly fork out? Thousands of other households must have also been overcharged. What are the meter readers reading? They are given A4 papers with lines on to write the readings. In 25 years I am sure a lot of them have learnt to read and write. This use of estimates is the municipality's way of overcharging the public. This money is kept in the municipality's bank account for another two to three months before we are credited. That's a lot of money in their account to move around. Please guys, do things properly. Your system can give you a proper estimate, unless it is programmed to make you rich. Bala Govender Woodview Daily News
