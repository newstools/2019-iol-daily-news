Aside from the municipal Sizakala Centre being pelted with stones, along with municipal cars parked in the lot, a community hall that had been closed because of damage during previous protests was also damaged. Police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said hostel residents embarked on a protest on Monday because of a power blackout. “They blockaded Musa and Malandela roads and pelted stones at the railway station. A 26-year-old suspect was arrested and charged with public violence. He appeared yesterday in Ntuzuma Magistrate’s Court,” she said. Councillor Lindiwe Ncayiyana said a community meeting was called on Sunday to address the electricity issue. “A traditional leader had explained to residents that the electricity infrastructure had been tampered with so much that it would cost approximately R3 million to fix,” she said. Ncayiyana said expected development at the hostel - including fixing communal ablution facilities that have not been working for nearly six months - was also on the agenda. She said the residents were assured that the electricity would be restored within the coming week. She said the blackout was because of a faulty transformer. Daily News
