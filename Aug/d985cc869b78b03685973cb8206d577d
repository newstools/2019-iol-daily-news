Captain Nqobile Gwala said that after arresting one of the men on Saturday, on Sunday the Phoenix task team arrested three more suspects in Maphumulo. Gwala said more arrests were expected. The first suspect was arrested in Berghaven and was identified by the robbery victim. Cable ties and a gas gun were found in his possession. The six men entered a house in Forest Haven on August 10, posing as police officers. Once inside, they threatened the occupants with firearms and ransacked the house. They stole two TV sets, five cellphones, a sound system and other items, including cash. The family was also assaulted. “We’re appealing to our communities to resist the temptation to buy stolen goods. The market for stolen goods is contributing to criminals committing further crimes,” said Gwala. Phoenix community police forum chairperson Umesh Singh said the man arrested on Saturday was a former police officer. “We’ve heard there were people posing as police officers, using blue lights, who rob people,” Singh said. “Residents need to ask for details like the officer’s appointment card, which has a photo of them and their force number. They can also confirm with the police before inviting officers into their homes, or ask for a search warrant.” Daily News
