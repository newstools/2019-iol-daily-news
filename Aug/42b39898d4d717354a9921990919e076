Durban - An eThekwini full council which was supposed to be held Thursday where the new mayor and deputy mayor were expected to be formally sworn in to office has been cancelled. Text messages were sent to councillors on Wednesday morning notifying them to that fact. The messages read: “Dear Cllr, Plz be advised that the Council meeting scheduled for Thursday, 29 August 2019 has now been POSTPONED to a date still to be advised. From:Secretariat” Mdu Nkosi, IFP leader in the eThekwini council said the cancellation was “anti-progress” and “anti-service delivery”. “This is a disgrace and total disrespect of the ratepayers of this municipality. Service delivery will be affected and we will see the rise in irregular expenditure. I’ve never seen a confused leadership like the one headed by the ANC,” Nkosi said. He said this will cripple committees as no recommendations can be made with regards to service delivery. Recommendations for the executive committee (exco) agenda items are taken in the different committees and from there to full council for endorsement. The ANC earlier this month axed the entire eThekwini Municipality executive committee including embattled mayor, Zandile Gumede and her deputy, Fawzia Peer. They were all forced to hand in their resignations on Monday. They are being replaced by KZN MEC for Transport, Mxolisi Kaunda as mayor, former KZN Finance MEC, Belinda Scott as deputy and Weziwe Thusi as speaker. The new executive were meant to be sworn in on Thursday. Daily News
