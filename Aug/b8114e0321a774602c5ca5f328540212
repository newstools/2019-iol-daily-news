Durban - A police constable stationed at the Durban North police station will make his first appearance in the Durban Magistrate's Court on Thursday to face charges of corruption. Colonel Thembeka Mbele, a KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson, said the 30-year-old officer was arrested in the Durban Central Business District on Tuesday night. "It is alleged that on 19 August 2019, the complainant crashed his vehicle and the police officer did not open a case. He towed the vehicle and informed the vehicle owner to pay him R7 000 in cash for him to release his vehicle," she said. Mbele said a police operation was conducted immediately after this was brought to their attention. The policeman was detained at the Durban Central police station "Two cellphones as well as cash that was handed over to him were seized by police. The community is commended for bringing such corrupt practices to the attention of police so that such individuals can be brought to book. There is no place in the SAPS for corrupt police officers," Mbele said. Daily News
