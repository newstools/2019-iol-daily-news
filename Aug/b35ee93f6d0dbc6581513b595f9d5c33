Advanced Life Support was called in to treat a 63-year old man was transported to a private hospital for the further care he required,"he said. The Shallcross Crimeforum sent out a warning on its Facebook group for residents soon after the robbery. "As much as we have security and armed reaction etc. let's not take for granted that we are 100% safe. These criminals do their homework and are opportunists. They wait for us to make a mistake and then they strike. Let's ensure that our gates are all locked and before we exit our homes, check around the yard and gate for people loitering. Yesterday we had a house robbery on Rocky mountain drive andÂ  again on Naicker road. Please be vigilant of your surroundings at all times." the message read. Daily News
