The department said it had received a report about 6.30pm of the shooting of six people at different locations in Edendale township, Pietermaritzburg. “It is unfortunate that the killings occurred when I had already planned a community meeting in Mbali to assess plans we put in place to improve policing in the entire policing precinct. I have interacted with the police management to ensure that the suspects implicated in this incident are found within 72 hours,” said Kaunda. Those killed were four men and two women, the department said. Kaunda sent his condolences to their families and said he would be meeting police officials about the incidents and the state of crime in the area. He said that today he would meet the community of Mbali township, who had complained to him about rampant crime in the area when he visited there in June. The department said that a safety plan had been developed that included having greater police visibility, and tackling crimes such as carjacking, murder and armed robberies. Police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said she could not say if the murders were related as the police had not yet made an arrest and investigations were ongoing. Daily News
