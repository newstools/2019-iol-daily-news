Was it used to pay for transport, accommodation, hiring of Nasrec and meals? OPINION - Shouldnâ€™t meeting these bills be the responsibility of the ANC itself? Or was the R400m used to bribe delegates to vote for the president? Who were the beneficiaries? Does he have to give them something in return? I personally believe President Ramaphosa is a good man and has good intentions, but he has made mistakes. Like Marikana. He has lied to Parliament and we are to learn how many more lies are out there. But will the CR17 donations be the mistake that sinks him? And who will take over if he goes? South Africa is at a dangerous crossroads and is held hostage by ANC state capture, incompetence, corruption, looting, factionalism, socialism and reckless behaviour.
