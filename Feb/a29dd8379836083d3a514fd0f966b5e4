Should we believe his words as weighty ones? He said: “This task of building a better South Africa is our collective task as a nation, as the people of South Africa. Our society is anchored in the roots of tolerance, as well as co-existence.” Why then did he choose to not recognise or single out Buthelezi? Does he want to tell us that Buthelezi did not contribute to building this country? Which tolerance and coexistence is he referring to when he fails to realise what Shenge did and is still doing for this country? Does Ramaphosa fail to understand that, with years left for Buthelezi in his life, he can still contribute as far as benefiting a contingent of future leaders, be it political or otherwise.
