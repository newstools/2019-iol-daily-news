The KZN ANCYL provincial chairperson, Kwazi Mshengu, said the league was saddened by the loss of life. “We think that under no circumstances should we allow a situation where there is loss of life. We understand that there has been a confrontation between the EFFSC and the security on this (DUT) campus, but we want to appeal to everyone exercise restraint, and exercise caution,” said Mshengu. He said students were raising genuine issues and said there should have never been a loss of life while doing so,” he said. Mshengu urged students to “keep calm and focused, exercise restraint even under circumstances of provocation”. The EFFSC meanwhile, called for a national shutdown in solidarity with the slain student. Daily News
