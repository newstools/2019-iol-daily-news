The SPCA shared the statistics in a Facebook post on their Facebook page. “I'm sure you can understand that not even close to this number get adopted each month. We never turn an animal away, and for the animals, our SPCA is one of the safest places they could be, as once an animals steps through our doors, they will never experience suffering again. They will either be adopted out to an amazing home, or be humanely put to sleep. But I'm sure you can imagine that this is still absolutely devastating for our staff,” the post said.
