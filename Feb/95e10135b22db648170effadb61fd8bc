It puts South Africa firmly on the world map of underwater photography and will promote tourism to South Africa in the diving industry, more specifically shark diving which has become a very popular activity for underwater divers and photographers from around the world,” said Walker. “Aliwal Shoal on the KZN South Coast boasts some of the best shark diving in the world and is definitely a must-visit attraction.
