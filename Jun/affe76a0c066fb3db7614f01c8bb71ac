Three men - believed to be behind a string of house robberies -  were collared by police today after a dramatic car chase through the streets of Durban North that saw robbers flip the stolen car they were driving which landed on its roof. Their crime spree came to an end on Chris Hani Road (North Coast Road)  just before dawn thanks to a coordinated effort by police and private security company, Marshall Security. According to Marshall Security, the suspects had held up a female homeowner in Umhlanga at around 4am and made off with a Mercedes. Following reports from the scene, Marshall security found that the suspects gained entry into the home by cutting the security gate using bolt cutters. The three suspects then confronted the homeowner, pepper sprayed her before locking her in her room. They ransacked the house and made off with a number of items including a flat screen TV  all of which was eventually recovered. A description of the vehicle was distributed to all security vehicles and a special operations team spotted it on the N2 southbound carriageway and a high-speed chase ensued thereafter. “An attempt to evade arrest the suspect vehicle turned off at the M25 Kwa Mashu Highway offramp where the driver lost control of the stolen Mercedes-Benz, causing it to overturn,” said Marshall Security. The car was heavily damaged with most of the windows broken Marshsall security believes the suspects are linked to a string of house robberies in the Sunninghill area.
