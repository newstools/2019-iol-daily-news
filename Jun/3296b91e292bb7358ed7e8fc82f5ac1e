In April 2019, the Merebank community voiced their concerns over a local park that was taken over by drug addicts. Whoonga addicts, who frequent Sialkot Park, are terrorising the ward 75 community in Merebank. In November 2014, a fruit and vegetable hawker had a near-death experience when she was hit in the leg by a stray bullet and then knocked over on the pavement and dragged by a car involved in a high-speed chase and shooting in Merebank. The shooting emanated from a drug deal that went wrong at the Dinapur Road flats. Daily News
