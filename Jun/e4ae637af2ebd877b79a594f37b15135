Three or four good balls are usually followed by one rank bad ball which allows the opposing batsmen to get easy boundaries and to relieve any pressure which may have been built. Pressure is built on batsmen, which forces them to take chances to get runs and creates opportunities to get wickets, by sustained tight bowling, backed up by good fielding. There was a time when the South African fielding was the envy of the cricketing world, but not any longer. Other countries have now improved their fielding prowess to the point where they surpass in this discipline. Too many easy runs are given to the opposition through sloppy fielding and far too many wickets thrown away through dropped catches. J. AMOD Durban Daily News
