Durban - A gardener was injured in a fight with a man who was later arrested for attempting to steal plants from a property in Hillcrest Park in the Upper Highway area on Monday. The incident occurred at around 8am. Blue Security community and media liaison officer Andreas Mathios said the gardener had just arrived at work when he noticed a man digging in the rubbish bins outside. The gardener noticed that plants from the complex entrance were missing. "When he checked the plastic bags that the man had with him he found the uprooted, missing plants inside the bags. An argument and a fight broke out.  The man bit the gardener on his hands. Our officer responded to the scene and arrested the suspect. The gardener declined medical assistance and was treated on site by a resident,” Mathios said. The suspect was handed over to the Hillcrest SAPS. It is not clear if any charges were laid against him.
