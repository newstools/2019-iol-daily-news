Durban - The Deputy Director of Public Prosecutions in KwaZulu-Natal Advocate Kombisa “KK" Mbakaza has been arrested and charged for conspiracy to murder his estranged wife. The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) on Wednesday confirmed that Mbakaza was arrested and released on R2 000 bail. Natasha Kara, NPA spokesperson, said Mbakaza was charged with conspiracy to murder and would appear in court again on August 28. Kara could not confirm any further details surrounding the investigation, saying this could jeoparsdise the case against Mbakaza. Mbakaza was arrested on Tuesday following an investigation into allegations that he had approached hit men and offered them money to murder his wife. He appeared in the Durban Magistrate's Court on Tuesday and was released on bail. The alleged hit men apparently approached the police and reported him. A case was opened in Bisho in the Eastern Cape, but since the alleged transaction happened in Durban, the case was handed over to Warrant Officer Rajan Govender, an investigator attached to the Provincial Organised Crime Unit. It is alleged that Mbakaza met with the two men on March 20 in the Glenwood area in Durban to discuss the details of the murder plot and to negotiate a payment. It is alleged that Mbakaza also paid the two men a small part of the payment. The Daily News has learnt that his estranged wife is a prosecutor in the Eastern Cape. Daily News
