He was known as the first democratically elected civilian president in Egypt’s long history. Unfortunately, he was ousted by an illegitimate coup and unjustly incarcerated for many years. His premature death in custody was predictable due to the Egyptian regime’s inability to treat prisoners with dignity and in accordance with international law. It was sad to see on the news how the popularly elected Morsi would appear in a red prison outfit and in a cage during his court proceedings. Moreover, it was heart-breaking for Egypt’s revolution and democracy that Morsi spent his last few years without help and all alone in prison. Although we should not expect a trustworthy independent investigation into Morsi’s death, I support the call for a neutral, in-depth and transparent probe into his sudden collapse in court and death. A warning to dictators and tyrants that always appear in public surrounded by the army and police is that citizens’ rule always prevails in the end. There will always be a small group of dedicated people who will fight the good fight against dictatorial regimes and occupiers. MOHAMED SAEED Pietermaritzburg Daily News
