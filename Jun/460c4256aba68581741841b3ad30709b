The state of the road had deteriorated to a shocking state, which made it positively dangerous to traverse as the surface undulated alarmingly in places and had large potholes in others. This resulted in motorists swerving dangerously from lane to lane to avoid the worst. We look forward to a vastly improved surface when the works are completed. In the meanwhile, and predictably, there is complete chaos at the interchange to the N2, with the intersections becoming gridlocked even during what could be considered “off-peak” times. Can the metro police not intervene here and ensure that motorists not enter the intersection unless they can clear it before the lights change? At the moment it takes up to 15 minutes to travel just a few hundred metres between Wakesleigh Road and the interchange, an extremely expensive exercise in these times of extremely high fuel prices.
