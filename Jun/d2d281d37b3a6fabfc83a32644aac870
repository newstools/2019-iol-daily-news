Durban - A shipping container filled with name brand clothing was stolen from a truck depot in Clairwood on Sunday night. Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane, a KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson, said the security guard at the premises alleged that at 8 pm he was performing his duties on Archary Road in Clairwood when four armed men forcefully entered the premises. "At gunpoint they took a container full of clothing, a trailer and three cellphones before fleeing the scene.  No shots were fired. A case of robbery is being investigated at Brighton Beach SAPS," Zwane said. The estimated value of the clothing was R800 000. Unconfirmed sources says the guard was also beaten up and stuffed into his guard hut on the premises.  He was treated for head injuries. One of the robbers kept watch over the guard during the theft of the container. It is alleged that the robbers had arrived with their own truck. By Monday afternoon police had not said if they found the shipping container and clothing. Daily News
