I admit it: I’m guilty of using plastic bags even though I know they are harmful to the environment and especially to the oceans. I use reusable cloth bags at the grocery store and I recycle plastic bags at home, but I could do more; we could all do more. I am equally guilty of using plastic straws even though I know they, too, are harmful to the environment. The problem with straws is that they are small and usually not recycled. The use of plastic straws and all plastic material needs to end. It’s critical for the use of single-use plastic straws, cups, and utensils, and plastic bags in our community to stop. I think most people recognise the need to make good choices for the planet, with a return to paper straws, or to check out new alternatives to purchase, such as glass or metal straws. Most importantly, it’s time to take plastic bags out of supermarkets. Plastic bags are a serious environmental issue, and are a major contributor to ocean pollution. Every year, 8 million metric tons of plastic end up in the ocean. I can do better and so can we all. All it takes is a little determination. Our oceans, in particular, are in desperate need of our caring. Daily News
