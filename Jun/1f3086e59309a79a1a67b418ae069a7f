The 25-year-old father of one, Tyrone Macus, had previously been convicted of a string of other crimes relating to theft in the Wentworth area, an area described by magistrate Lee Bonhome as “a no-go area” because of such crimes. The victim, Thandeka Jama, was speaking on her phone outside her workplace when Macus grabbed the device and ran off. In his plea statement, he said he gave the phone to a friend, who sold it for him for R400. Macus, who had been in custody for more than a year awaiting trial, pleaded guilty to robbing Jama of her phone. The phone was later recovered from the person who bought it and further information led the police to Macus. Prosecutor Loyiso Ncemane said Macus had five previous convictions for crimes relating to theft and one of being in possession of stolen goods. Daily News
