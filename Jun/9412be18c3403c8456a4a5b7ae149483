Durban - Two Durban Metro police officers have been lauded for helping a woman deliver her baby on the pavement in the Point area on Tuesday night. The officers, Ntombizandile Dladla and Busisiwe Buthelezi from the Boscombe Terrace Metro Police base, had been on patrol when they noticed that a woman was in distress at the corner of Gillespie Street and Anton Lembede (Smith) Street. Durban Metro police spokesperson Senior Superintendent Parboo Sewpersad said Dladla and Buthelezi realised the woman was going into labour. "We believe the 25 year-old mother was a destitute person. They assisted and helped the woman deliver a healthy baby boy. The woman and the baby were transported to Addington Hospital," Sewpersad said. Durban Mayor Fawzia Peer Durban, who heads the safety and security cluster in the eThekwini Municipality, commended the officers for going beyond the call of duty. "The safe delivery of a baby has proven that the Durban Metro police are adequately trained to handle any situation. Their actions prove to society that police are proactive and ready to help," Peer said. Daily News
