Garrith Jamieson, operations director at Rescue Care, said one person was killed and four were injured in a crash near Clermont yesterday morning. “Rescue Care paramedics arrived on the scene to find carnage. A single vehicle with five occupants had collided into the concrete barriers. One person, an elderly gentleman, sustained major injuries and he was declared deceased on scene.” The injured were taken to hospital. Also on Monday a person died and three were injured on the N2 south bound before the M7 interchange when a driver lost control and went down the embankment. Jamieson said that when paramedics arrived they found that there was nothing they could do to help the male who was believed to be the driver of the vehicle. The three injured passengers were stabilised and taken to hospital. On Sunday night, one person was killed and four were injured on the M1 Higginson Highway near Shallcross. The injured included a 2 year old and a 10 year old. Jamison said police were investigating the various incidents.
