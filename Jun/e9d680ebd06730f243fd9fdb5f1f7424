According to the International Monetary Fund, South Africaâ€™s biggest obstacle to sustained economic growth stems from a lack of investment in human capital. This is where business, especially those driving profits with purpose, can make the greatest contribution to turning the economy around. But the government must meet business halfway. Greater tax incentives for businesses who hire and train school-leavers, ensuring that every employee in the private sector has the opportunity to be upskilled in their place of work, would be excellent starting points. Business can partner with the government to share much-needed management and leadership skills and expertise, particularly within the education sector. As business, we might have limited influence over the factors driving the low growth rate over the next two to three years, but we do have direct influence over how we respond to the challenges. How we choose to create value on our balance sheets, within our organisations, and within our country, is up to us. Adam Craker Edenburg Daily News
