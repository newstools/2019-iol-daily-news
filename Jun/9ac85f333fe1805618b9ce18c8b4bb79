Durban - Relief  could be on the way for the thousands of families who lost their houses during the Durban floods as the Department for Human Settlements has approved about R90 million for rebuilding purposes. This was revealed by MEC for Corporate Governance and Traditional Affairs, Sipho Hlomuka, at a media briefing on Tuesday. The briefing was to give an update on relief efforts done by the government since the floods first hit on the 22nd of April, killing 70 people in eThekwini alone. The figure is still incredibly short of the R650m damage COGTA calculated will be needed to remedy the situation in eThekwini alone. "We have still waiting for other departments (Transport, Education  and Water and Sanitation) we are hopeful they will approve soon," said Hlomuka. The  money from human settlements will be divided as such: R42.3-million on  772 transitional housing units R30.1-million to assist 3017 households with building materials to rebuild their homes, and  R14.3-million for relocation costs where it is deemed necessary. Sipho Nzuza, eThekwini City Manager  said the municipality has enacted a task team to find suitable land where houses will be built. Nzuza said a lot of houses were built in unsuitable areas and the city's priority is to make sure the new houses are built on safe land. Across the city, MEC Social Developments was visiting 72 families around the Marianhill area, who were victims to the floods. Daily News
