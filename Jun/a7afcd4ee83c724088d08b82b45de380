Durban - Eighteen computers were stolen from the KwaDukuza offices of the South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) – forcing the offices to close for the day and throwing into disarray the applications of hundreds of people who use the offices to apply for government grants. It is alleged that a group of between five and 10 men arrived at the Department of Social Development’s offices in Yellowwood Drive and held up two security guards, who were on duty on Tuesday. Police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane said the guards were on duty when they were accosted by five men carrying firearms just after 1am. At gunpoint, the men tied up the victims with cable ties. Zwane said the men took 18 computers and drove away in the company vehicle. Police could not say how many guards were at the premises. Mbizeni Mdlalose, Sassa KwaZulu-Natal spokesperson, confirmed a robbery had taken place. He said the guards were held at gunpoint and the computers were stolen from the offices. Mdlalose said service delivery at the offices would only be affected today because the office had become a crime scene. “We hope by tomorrow the office will be operating normally. Sassa is making contingency plans to normalise the situation,” he said. With month-end a few days away, Mdlalose said this would hamper payouts to senior citizens and other grant collectors. “This will have a little impact if any on payment of social grants. Grants collection will continue as normal,” he said. Sassa was concerned the computers might end up in the wrong hands. There have been cases were fraudulent Sassa cards were made and syndicates arrested. Mdlalose said they were confident that the police would be able to bring the culprits to book soon. A case of robbery was opened at KwaDukuza police station. Daily News
