Durban- The Ugu Municipality has promised a comprehensive response about the current state of one of its Wastewater Works Treatment Plant after serious questions were raised by the Daily News this week. A Harding farmer captured what looks like employees at the plant releasing untreated wastewater into the Umzimkulwana  river. Umzimkulwana joins Umzimkulu river which runs into the ocean. Bertie Strydom on Monday posted the video in which he shot on Saturday on a facebook page. Strydom’s video comes at a time when Ugu us dealing with water shortages and cuts with some homes not having water for nearly over a month now. Municipal spokesperson France Zama asked that the city be afforded the opportunity to investigate the events which might have led to the occurrence. “I will thereafter provide the municipality’s stance on the matter with responses to your questions,” he said. Strydom said his farm was 27km down the stream, in Bhongwana, and already they have been four still born calves at his farm.

I have 137 heads of cattle and I have already lost four calves, all in one week”. Daily News
