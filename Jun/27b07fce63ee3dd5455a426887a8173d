Durban - Gannets have given up the location of sardine shoals between East London and Port St Johns on Friday. Greg Thompson, the Acting: Head of Operations KwaZulu-Natal Sharks Board said they have received confirmed reports of sardine related activity between the Nqabara River Mouth and the Dwesa Marine Reserve on Thursday. "It was reported that there were large shoals of fish spotted with thousands of gannets feeding in amongst these shoals. We also received a report of activity in the Rame Heads area which is 26 km South of Port St Johns. This activity consisted of common dolphins and gannets feeding in this area,"he said. Thompson said there have been no further sightings of much activity north of this but hopefully the sardine activity will increase between Port St Johns and Port Edward after the cold front passes. "Please keep in mind that most of the reporting and feedback we are receiving is in the inshore areas, so as we all know there is always a possibility of being surprised by fish which have moved through undetected in the deeper waters. These fish are very unpredictable and have always kept us all guessing about their movement,"Thompson said. There are always numerous opinions but one seldom guesses right when it comes to sardines.
