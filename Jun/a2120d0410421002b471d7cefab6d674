“There is a definite increase in gannets in the area, with a couple of large rafts of birds seen too. Apart from that, there is no sign of actual sardines yet,” said Greg Thompson, acting head of operations at the Sharks Board. The sardine run occurs during June and July, when shoals of the fish swim upstream on the east coast to take advantage of the cooler water. It is a hugely anticipated event for fishermen and spectators. Thompson has been tracking the sardines for the past month through the Eastern Cape. “We received reports of good sardine-related activity between Manteku and Mbotyi over the long weekend. The divers operating out of Port St Johns reported numerous bait balls and loads of gannets and dolphins feeding in this area,” he said. Thompson said they were now waiting for when the shoal would make its way to KZN shores. Shameen Caesar, a chemical operations controller and recreational fisherman, has been keeping track of the sardines’ location on social media. Caesar said he was usually at Addington Beach for the run. “We have been getting ready in terms of checking our equipment and making sure everything is working. It is an exciting time for everyone,” he said. Daily News
