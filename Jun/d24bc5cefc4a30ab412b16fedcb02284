Those earmarked for this Source to Sea initiative are Umgeni River, uMlazi River, uMbilo River, uMhlatuzana River and aManzimnyama River. Albi Modise, DEA spokesperson, said the project would kick off next month and is expected to be completed in two years. “It will be an ambitious and new strategy geared to investigate and combat pollution, in particular plastic pollution, at source in river catchments and waterways, before it reaches the coast and marine environment,” he said. Alex Benkenstein, head of Governance of Africa’s Resources Programme at the South African Institute of International Affairs, said: “I think the approach the department is taking is necessary and appropriate. If you don’t tackle the problem at the source it’s going to be very difficult to make any sort of headway.” Daily News
