Mangosuthu Highway near V-section had been re-opened to traffic but not without the efforts of dedicated police officers said Durban Metro Police Senior superintendent Parboo Sewpersad. "Early this morning an unknown amount of people barricaded the road with park benches, concrete blocks, broken glass and tree branches. When the police arrived the people had fled.
