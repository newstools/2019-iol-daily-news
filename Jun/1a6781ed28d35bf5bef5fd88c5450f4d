The initial budget proposed last year was R27.3 million; last week the city proposed an additional R4.4m. The event, which takes place every three years, will be held in November and be hosted jointly by the city and SA Local Government Association (Salga). According to a costing report tabled recently at exco, the event was the largest, most influential local and regional world leaders’ conference and global gathering of mayors, councillors, local governments and development partners. The event attracts at least 100 countries, which would enable the city to showcase its tourism and economic potential to at least 3500 delegates. Durban won the bid at the 2017 edition of the event. An initial report was submitted to exco and tabled to the council in April and May last year, where the council resolved to approve R27.3m towards the event. The budget would cover venue hire (ICC), public realms upgrades, overtime for metro police, volunteers and any contingencies. The ICC would be hired for R20.74m. Lance Joel from Salga’s office of the chief executive, said their technical team was yet to meet in the next few weeks. “Once we meet we will present the report to the joint political heads including eThekwini exco and Salga presidency,” he said.
