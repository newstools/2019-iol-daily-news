Some judges and magistrates are being lenient with criminals responsible for so many crimes. Is this the legacy you want to leave, of your judgments handed down? Give stiffer sentences to criminals! If the laws are inadequate, you have a minister to appeal to, and Iâ€™m almost certain that accessing the powers that be cannot be that difficult. Sentencing is intended to provide a general and specific deterrent to crime. Neither the general population nor the business sector directly affected by crime are convinced that criminals are being punished appropriately. Courts are supreme on the interpretations and applications of laws; therefore, I do not need to tell them how important it is to our freedom, that they find a way to ensure crimes are paid for fully. In these times, there should be no concurrent running sentences in gun or murder-related matters, no small fines in egregious matters, and definitely no bail given to these kinds of offender. If we are to realise drastic changes in how people comply with the laws of South Africa, to include the Road Traffic Act, the sentences issued by the courts to lawbreakers must make that statement clear to all.
