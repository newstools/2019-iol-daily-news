Durban - Newly appointedÂ  KwaZulu-Natal MEC for Social Development Nonhlanhla Khoza said society should be "ashamed and embarrassed" that four children who were left alone in a home in Embo near Hillcrest children burnt to death after a fire broke out on Sunday. The MEC, who on Thursday was visiting the Maduna family said there should be consequences for people who abandon their children. She said that to make the situation even worst the little children's death came at the same time that the country observed child protection week. "I believe all the four kids had the right to live... someone should do something and someone should bear the consequences" she said.She said if people did not want children there were other avenues they could explore such as abortion, handing over the child over to social development or for foster care. A vigil was being held when Khoza visited as people sang hymns and comforted the bereaved family. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that
