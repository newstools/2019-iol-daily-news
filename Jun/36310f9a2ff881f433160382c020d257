About 50 people have been sleeping in open veld near Cato Crest Primary School since their shacks were torn down in a police raid on Saturday night. Sno Gambu, chairperson of Kwadedaslingo, a community forum of informal settlers at Cato Crest, said they got the mandate from councillor Muzumuni Ngiba to occupy the vacant land at Mary Thipe Road. Ngiba, however, has categorically denied instructing anyone to illegally occupy land. “We had a community meeting and I said that I agree that it is not right that land in this area is being occupied by outsiders when there are residents of Cato Crest who do not have land,” said Ngiba. “They are telling lies if they say I said they must invade land. I have been to that place and it is not a place where people can live; it is just a forest.” Mqapheli Bonono, provincial chairperson of Abahlali Basemjondolo, said the organisation did not support illegal land invasion. Abahlali currently has an interdict barring the city from demolishing the homes of 110 families living at eKhanana in Cato Crest. eThekwini municipality spokesperson Msawakhe Mayisela, said all evictions were done within the parameters of the law.
