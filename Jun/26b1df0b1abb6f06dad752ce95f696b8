Durban - An hour long search by security companies and the police led to the arrest of a burglar who had stolen a laptop, wristwatch and cellphone from a Kloof home. Blue Security spokesperson Andreas Mathios said the suspect had gained entry into a home in Gillits at around 8.30am on Sunday. He said the resident heard a shuffling sound coming from a back room and when he went to investigate he found that there was a burglar inside his home. "When the suspect saw him he turned and fled through an open window,” Mathios said. An armed response officer who was on his way to respond to the incident spotted the burglar walking up Everton Road. The officers chased the suspect down Surrey Lane. “The suspect then jumped into a property and started fence hopping in an attempt to evade arrest but our officer gave chase. The SAPS Shongweni K9 Unit also responded to the scene and with the assistance of the police the suspect was arrested after an hour long manhunt in the nearby valley,” Mathios said. Police recovered the stolen items. Kloof SAPS is investigating a case of burglary. Daily News
