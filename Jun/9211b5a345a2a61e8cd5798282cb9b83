We were told the problem was a grievance against foreign truck drivers. It has long since passed that as an excuse for it seems to have become a sport, on the one hand, and an expression of national frustration against increasing poverty, on the other. Whatever the reason, firm action has to stop this bleeding. I suggest, as a first step, the army be brought in and an armed serviceman be allocated to each vehicle. Furthermore, cable theft also has to be stopped as it too takes on aspects of national sabotage. For that, I suggest a special SAPS division be formed. Failure to halt these diseases can lead to more civil disobedience, so Mr Cyril Ramaphosa, effective and quick management, if you please. Itâ€™s your country too.
