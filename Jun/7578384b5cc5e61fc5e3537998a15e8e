I felt this kinship with President Ramaphosa when, during #SONA2019, he spoke of his dream of a bullet train speeding from, among other cities, Durban to Johannesburg. My mind replayed the dream that John F Kennedy spoke about during his inaugural speech in 1961 about putting a man on the moon before the decade was out. He didn’t get to see Neil Armstrong utter those immortalised words from Tranquility Base on the moon: “One small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.” Those who scoff at President Ramaphosa should also remember what Robert Kennedy said: “Some men see things as they are, and ask why; I dream of things that never were, and ask why not.” These days there’s a surplus of the former and just a handful of the latter. The former underestimate the power of the imagination to bring mind-forged ideas into corporeality. You, Mr President, should lay the tracks for that train even though you and I may not ride on it.
