Ryan said a family were held up in their home by robbers on Saturday, a woman was hijacked off a her car and a man delivering stock to a tuckshop was robbed during the course of the week in Newlands East. “We trying very hard with what we have. We asked the residents to take control of their streets just to monitor any suspicious vehicles and people loitering. We understand the police have limited staff. Our NEWCS use cars to patrol and our own costs. We wish we could be subsidised and the city would install CCTV cameras at our five exit points.  We are actually the ears and eyes for the police,”she said. Daily News
