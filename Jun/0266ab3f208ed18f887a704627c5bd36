The manner in which our pupils have to travel to get to school is untenable and we should not wait on unfortunate incidents to necessitate a proper and planned approach. In the absence of a regulated system of transportation, anything goes. The practice of cramped/overloaded taxis, speeding and recklessness, lewd music and vulgarity are pervading the landscape. The traffic is heavy for want of a school bus system, so the operators capitalise on it to the detriment of the pupils. The recent accidents involving our pupils is a warning sign and an indication of our plight. A rural bus system would be far-reaching and very effective. Though costly, this should not deter a good venture which would benefit our pupils, most of whom travel from far and wide from rural areas. As their guardians, parents and responsible leaders, we must protect them. Some of these very children will be elevated to high leadership positions and will lead this country tomorrow. So, let us do our best for a sustainable future, so that they may build on our legacy. Daily News
