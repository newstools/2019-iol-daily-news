The Daily News reported last month that been Pillay was beaten up, set alight and died a days after naming the five men in court as his assailants. During the bail application the defence, had pointed out to various flaws conducted by Independent Police Investigative Directorate's investigating officer Zimisele Hlophe. When Dube made the announcement family members of the men expressed shock at the decision with some of them immediately walking out of the courtroom while others were crying. Rodgers Pillay, older brother of Pillay said he was happy at the outcome of the bail hearing. “Justice has been served,” he said. The men are set to make their next appearance on July 17. Daily News
