The 26-year-old was accepted into the fellowship, which forms part of former US president Barack Obama’s Young African Leaders Initiative. Born in Ohlange, Inanda, Ncwane is among the 700 fellows from sub-Saharan Africa who would hone their skills at a US higher education institution and be given support for professional development when she returns. “It’s an honour and a blessing to be part of this prestigious international programme, especially for someone who has my background. When I return home, I want to encourage other young people to also be a part of it,” she said. Ncwane will be based at the University of Delaware Newark and will be participating in a course on civil leadership. Apart from being an actress and television personality, Ncwane has undertaken community work and heads the Portia Ncwane Foundation. Based in Newlands East, where she lives, the foundation seeks to get youth and disadvantaged communities into the arts industry. Ncwane has provided uniforms to disadvantaged pupils, hosted mentorship seminars and also organised talent shows at many schools in her district. She had faced a gruelling three-month wait for a decision from the US embassy after undergoing interviews. Daily News
