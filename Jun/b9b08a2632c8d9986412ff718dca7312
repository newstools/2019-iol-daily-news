President Cyril Ramaphosa has made a wise choice by appointing an honest, dedicated and good woman. He was at liberty to hand this position to an ANC comrade but chose to go the way of former president Nelson Mandela and appointed a person of good standing from the opposition benches. This is what we call a government of national unity and a government of the people. A big thank you to the people who made this possible by voting for the Good Party and De Lille. Your vote for a “small party” made a big change in Parliament. We trust De Lille will do her best to root out corruption and to make land and buildings under her portfolio more available for the best use by the public and the government.
