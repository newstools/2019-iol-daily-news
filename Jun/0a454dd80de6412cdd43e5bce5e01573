On Monday, refuse collection was disrupted in uMlazi after sub-contractors protested because they had apparently not been paid for several months by the main contractor. Municipal workers this week collected garbage strewn over the township under metro police guard. An insider with information on the matter said the city had erred in awarding the multimillion-rand refuse collection tender to only one company, Uzuzinekele Trading, which is also charged in the tender fraud case. He said sub-contractors, including th Amadelangokubona Business Forum, were involved in the disruption of refuse collection. “They are right because they have not been paid for three months. The main contractor was given the tender and more sub-contractors - more than double those he had when he submitted the bid - were imposed on him. That was to ensure that certain individuals got a slice of the pie. “The main contractor has since refused to pay the sub-contractors who were imposed on him by those involved in this multimillion-rand tender scam,” said the insider. The Daily News was unable to reach Uzuzinekele Trading management for comment. Daily News
