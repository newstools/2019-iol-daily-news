Durban - Two paramedics were robbed in Phoenix while loading a patient into an ambulance on Wednesday night. According to Phoenix Crime Watch, KZN VIP response units rushed to the scene after receiving reports that KZN Emergency Medical Services (EMRS) paramedics were being held up. “Upon arrival it is believed that three male suspects held up the two paramedics whilst they were loading a patient, valuables were taken before the suspects fled,” Phoenix Crime Watch said. Phoenix Crime Watch said the paramedics were unharmed but were severely traumatised. They also called for anyone who had information to contact Phoenix police on 031 508 2308. Over a week ago, two EMRS paramedics were called out to a fake emergency, where they were robbed and shot in Amatikwe in Inanda, north of Durban. One paramedic was shot in the back while the other was shot on the wrist. According to Phoenix Crime Watch, they were still recovering in hospital. Last week the Daily News reported a robbery and shooting of paramedics had ignited the call for paramedics to be armed while on duty. Oliver Wright, South African Private Ambulance & Emergency Services Association (Sapaesa) chief executive, said they did not encourage EMS practitioners to carry firearms while on duty and when working within the ambulance environment. Police had not commented on the incident at the time of publication. Daily News
