For a long time, the SOEs were bleeding our major finances that went to murky and dishonest looters of the state coffers. Instead of upgrades and running the parastatals efficiently, billions were stolen, there was maladministration and the whole country bled. For a long time, I have been saying SOEs have destroyed South Africa, and anyway, who needs SAA to travel, and what for? It has been siphoning our precious resources; it is a black hole. The government either needs to sell it immediately or take on a strong, business-minded partner. Professionals are needed to run these SOEs. The way forward for South Africa is business. Name and fame should not be the forefront issues as we have bigger things to worry about, like rands and cents and bread on the table. I hope Parliament and all parties will discuss South Africa first, and not individual performances. We are tired of these sideshows. FAROUK SALOOJEE Rustenburg Daily News
