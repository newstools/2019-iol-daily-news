Education MEC Kwazi Mshengu had been speaking at the funeral of school teacher Sibonakaliso Nyawose, who was shot and killed last week at Masuku Primary School in Folweni, outside uMlazi. Mshengu said his department would be working with national SAPS, as well as the Department of Community Safety and Liaison, in the province. When he was asked about a suggestion made by one of the teachers’ unions that teachers should carry firearms to school, in a bid to protect themselves, Mshengu said the department was against it. “Guns are intimidating and anything could happen, and a pupil could be shot,” he said. Nyawose’s brother Kwenzokuhle Magwaza urged police to continue the search for his brother’s killers. “It would be disappointing not to catch them, as they may also tell us who sent them to kill my brother,” he said. Nyawose’s sister Simangele Nyawose said while the family was saddened by his death, they were not shocked that it happened while he was at school. “He sold his taxis, in 2016, to go back to teaching and I helped him find placement at Masuku Primary. Teaching was a calling to him more than anything,” she said. Daily News
