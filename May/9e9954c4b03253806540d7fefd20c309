Counterfeit items include face creams, name brand clothing, name brand shoes, hair products and certain over the counter medications. In November, R6 million worth of counterfeit clothing was confiscated during a sting operation at the King Shaka International Airport. The find followed a two-day operation undertaken by the South African Revenue Services (Sars). The operation saw Sars officials conducting a high-visibility operation in and around KSIA, along with their counterparts from SAPS, Immigration, Cross Boarder Road Traffic Agency and Metro Police. The aim of the operation was to clamp down on issues of non-compliance regarding the import and export of goods. In December, more than half a million rands in counterfeit goods were seized from three reputable stores in Durban. Knives and pens were among the items confiscated. Daily News
