Durban - Three children escaped unharmed while gunmen shot their father in the drivers seat in Verulam on Wednesday. The man was transporting his children to school and while travelling through Old Main Road he was shot by occupants in a red VW Polo. Prem Balram, a spokesperson for private security company Reaction Unit South Africa (RUSA), said they found the three hysterical children approximately 40 meters away from their father's bullet riddled SUV. "Paramedics assessed the driver and found that he had sustained multiple gun shot wounds to his head and body. Due to the extent of his injuries he died at the scene. According to witnesses the Toyota Fortuner was approaching the single lane steel bridge when a red VW Polo stopped next to it. The occupants of the VW Polo then opened fire at the driver before the gunmen then sped off towards the Verulam CBD," Balram said. The children aged 13,11 and 8 were seated behind their father and were not injured. Balram said approximately twenty one 9mm spent cartridges were recovered at the scene. The motive for the shooting is unknown at this stage. This is the second drive-by shooting in the passed 18 hours reported to RUSA in the Verulam area. Daily News
