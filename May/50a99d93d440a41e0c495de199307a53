Parties who do not remove their posters within 30 days of the elections face penalties. eThekwini Municipality spokesperson Msawakhe Mayisela said political parties paid R200 per ward to hang posters, restricted to 800 posters in each ward. “In the event of any breach by a party, the municipality (through the Development Planning Unit) would contact the party concerned and the removal of posters would be carried out within two days after the party concerned has been contacted,” he said. If political parties did not comply, the municipality would remove the posters and the party concerned would pay costs at the rate of R50 per poster and the deposits made would be forfeited to the municipality. Bulwer Safety and Urban Regeneration Forum chairperson Heather Rorick said posters should be removed a week or two after the elections at most. Daily News
