Durban - The Chatsworth garden and refuse collection site has been thoroughly cleaned and the roads and pavements are being sanitised on Thursday. A week ago, the pavements on Sagittarius Street was stacked high with domestic refuse bin bags filled with rotting household garbage. There was also a foul stench on the road and surrounding suburb. Chatsworth residents had no alternative but to place their bags of refuse at the site after the Durban Solid Waste embarked on a strike in the eThekwini Municipality. Refuse was not collected from the streets in the suburbs. Since last week, a clean-up team from DSW  removed piles of refuse. Workers from the eThekwini roads, electricity, water and sanitation and DSW downed tools after hearing about unfair pay packages in the city. It has emerged that MK vets employed by the water and sanitation department had their pay packages increased from R9 000 to R20 000 within a year. Municipality’ Spokesperson, Msawakhe Mayisela said private contractors and 100 volunteers have been brought on board to ensure all refuse in and around the city-centre is cleared. Daily News
