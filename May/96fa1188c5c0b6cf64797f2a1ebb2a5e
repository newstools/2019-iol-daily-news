Durban - Car thieves turned burglars when they wanted a Toyota Etios from a house in Cornubia north of Durban on Monday, police allege. Colonel Thembeka Mbele, a KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson, said the alleged burglary took place between Sunday midnight and the early hours of Monday morning. "A unknown number of thieves allegedly gained entry to the home by forcing open the toilet window. They took the car keys from inside the house and fled the scene with the complainant’s Toyota Etios,"Mbele said. On Monday police and  vehicle tracking units spotted the car in the vicinity of Nsuze near Ndwedwe. This was approximately 40 KM from Cornubia. Mbele said the driver of the Etios fled but crashed the car when he steered the car off the road and down a steep embankment. A 27-year-old suspect was arrested at the scene. He will appear in court soon.Charges of burglary and theft are being investigated by Verulam SAPS. Daily News
