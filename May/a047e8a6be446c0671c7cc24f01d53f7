Durban - The eThekwini electricity department said an attempt to steal cables from a substation along Johannes Nkosi (formerly Alice) Street caused the power outage in Durban on Tuesday. eThekwini Municipalityâ€™s spokesperson Msawakhe Mayisela said that two 132-kilovolt cables were damaged by a fire in a cable tunnel near the Alice Street substation. The cause of the fire is currently under investigation and emergency high-voltage repairs have commenced. "While 90 % of supply was restored within 3 hours by using the alternate High Voltage and Medium Voltage cables, there were some customers who experienced longer outages,"he said. By 13:40 PM, all supply was restored. "We appeal to all customers in affected areas to reduce unnecessary loading to the circuits to prevent overload tripping, especially during the afternoon peak. Switch off and unplug items not in use and when the electricity supply is interuppted." Tens of thousands of Durbanites woke up to no electricity on Tuesday after causing widespread black outs to at least 50 per cent of the city according to some estimates. The Daily News initially reported that a major substation blew up in Klaarwater but this was not true. Among the areas affected by the blackouts which occurred shortly after 5am was the Durban city centre, the beachfront, Glenwood, Umbilo and Congella. There were reports of no electricity as far west as Pinetown and Marianhill. Daily News
