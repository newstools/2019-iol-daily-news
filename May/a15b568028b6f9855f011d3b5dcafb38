“Durban is fundamentally broken; its political management, its city council and the workers are very unhappy.” Leon was speaking at Durban View Park, Umhlanga, yesterday when the DA was doing a recruitment drive prior to the general elections. Leon, who grew up in Durban, interacted with residents and handed out pamphlets. He said the most pressing issue for Durban residents was the municipal strike, which had resulted in water and electricity shortages throughout the region. Workers angry at increases given to Umkhonto weSizwe veterans dropped piles of rubbish across the Durban CBD on Tuesday. “I don’t for a moment condone what they did, but I fully understand why they do it because the workers’ roles were manipulated for political purposes. “Either you run a city properly for the advantage and benefit of all its citizens, or you do it for some political agenda which serves a narrow purpose.” Leon said the latest African Good Governance Network report was proof of the DA’s good governance record. The independent think tank showed that 14 of the 20 best-run municipalities were DA-led, with the Western Cape’s Mossel Bay being first. Daily News
