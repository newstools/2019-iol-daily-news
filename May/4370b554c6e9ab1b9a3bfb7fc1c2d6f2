Well done! Congratulations IFP! This was a good performance and you need to not sit on your laurels. You still have a long way to go. Build on this election foundation. Your leaders should go to the people and listen to their grievances. The IFP needs to do this because it is a party established to serve the people. We need to see it carrying our voices and concerns. Elections are not won on the election day, but long before that. If the IFP wants to control municipalities, it should start now to become more visible. People need tarred roads, electricity and renovation of schools. The local government elections are around the corner. Wake up and work, IFP! Maletsatse Sebotsa Kimberley Daily News
