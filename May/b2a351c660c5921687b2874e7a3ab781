The debacle arising from the ridiculous more than 100% increases given to MK veterans is of her making, because she gave the instruction to hire these people in eThekwini municipal departments. I would not be surprised if the instruction to give them these increases also came from her. The mayor is invisible while the city is trashed and was suspiciously, fortuitously absent from a council meeting crashed by those workers who did not get the increases given to the veterans. The anger of these workers is perfectly understandable, even if the methods they are using to express their anger are unacceptable. The hikes given to MK vets must surely be rescinded because it is doubtful the city can afford to give all its employees 100% increases to appease them. This mayor seems to be surrounded by controversy on all sides, beginning with the long intra-ANC fight waged to get her elected eThekwini region chairperson, which paved the way to become mayor. The Co-operative Governance Department and its MEC have also been conspicuously absent during this local government crisis. With elections only a few days away, the ANC needs to act swiftly and decisively if it hopes to retain any semblance of credibility among voters. Daily News
