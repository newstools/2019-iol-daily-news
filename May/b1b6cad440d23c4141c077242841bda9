What the world of social media has done is allow inner feelings to be revealed in, at times, unguarded moments. Helen Zille, the DA’s former Western Cape premier, has once again landed herself in hot water for her controversial tweets on “black privilege”. The party’s leader, Mmusi Maimane, characteristically milked the moment by exerting clout on an issue that, in my opinion, will fizzle out. Make no mistake, the spin doctors of the DA will use this issue to attempt to reveal their holier-than-thou attitude. Remember the Dianne Kohler Barnard debacle? Apparently, many sanctions were imposed on her. How many have been carried out?  While I’m a proponent of free speech, I’m acutely aware that freedom comes with responsibility, and Zille has exhibited irresponsibility. I believe not much will come of her indiscretion, despite outrage from the public. After all, the DA takes care of its own, unless one rocks the boat, in which case a disciplinary hearing is brutal with an outcome already decided. While Maimane may want us to believe he’s being decisive and taking the moral high ground, I believe Zille will get no more than a cautionary slap on the wrist. Sanjay Singh Queensburgh Daily News
