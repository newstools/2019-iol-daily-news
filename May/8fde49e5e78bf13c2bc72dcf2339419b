While Gumede has not been found guilty - and it could be years before a verdict is delivered - the taint surrounding her must surely be sufficient to warrant her removal from office by the ANC. Not just her, but other ANC officials accused of serious crime too, including the KwaZulu-Natal mayors charged with murder. The ANC won this month’s general elections, but not convincingly. If these people - leaders at local government level - are not removed from their positions, the party can expect to be soundly punished at the next local government elections, where the prospect of losing municipalities looms large. Former MEC Mike Mabuyakhulu, who has criminal charges of his own to deal with, set the tone by agreeing to be excluded from the party’s candidate list, and it is time these mayors with charges to answer followed suit. It will be interesting to see how the ANC handles what is obviously a hot potato. Gumede and the other mayors have support in their constituencies, which the ANC risks alienating by getting rid of them. I am eagerly awaiting the developments. Daily News
