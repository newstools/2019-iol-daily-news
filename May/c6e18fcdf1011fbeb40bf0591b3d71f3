The country desperately needs your leadership. You should not procrastinate any longer or fear a backlash from the Zuma faction. You are in a strong position. You have the majority in Parliament and you were elected unopposed. So show your strong hand and lead the country forward. Early indications are that President Cyril Ramaphosa will be good for the country. At least he won’t be as bad as Zuma. Mindful of the hard times we are in, he cut the inauguration budget by R100 million, which his predecessor would not have done. In keeping with his pruning measures, President Ramaphosa should clamp down on the lavish and extravagant tastes of ministers who have a penchant for luxury cars while their voters live in shacks. Zuma allies such as former speaker of the house Baleka Mbete and former finance minister Malusi Gigaba, who helped the Guptas become South African citizens, have been dumped. They were so shattered that they did not want to return to Parliament. Let’s have our fingers crossed that the rand and the markets react positively to his new cabinet. Anything less will spell disaster for the country and the economy. Moodie’s will downgrade us to junk status. Daily News
