“This is a commemoration of the rights of Biafra people who were killed during the war in the fight for our independence,” said Chukwu Emmanuel, one of the organisers. Biafra was a secessionist state in West Africa. After announcing plans for independence on May 30, 1967, a civil war ensued between Nigerian troops and Biafra separatists. The war lasted three years before Biafra surrendered its independence. May 30 has been used by indigenous Biafrans to commemorate those who died during that time. The International Committee of the Red Cross estimates that about 3 million died. Chiedu Nisendigo, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra in Durban, said he lost some of his siblings during the war. “We want Biafra to be free, to have our own land, resources and freedom for religious liberty,” he said. The group handed over a memorandum to an eThekwini Municipality official outside City Hall, asking the South African government to publicly align with its cause for Biafran independence. Daily News
