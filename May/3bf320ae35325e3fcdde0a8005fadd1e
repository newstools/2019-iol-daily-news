This is the attitude of the new generation public service on display, full of platitudes and acidic hostility, all designed to deliver the message that they are in control. Suddenly sitting on a perch, they feel invincible and in power. We just have to toe the line or take a hike. There is unvarnished narcissism at play here. Any question or request for an explanation is met on the defensive as they are used to dishing out sanitised, window-dressed, computerised answers. They buzz around like angry bees but manufacture little honey. There is an urgent need for an upgrade in decorum at these state service providers. I will very soon be making the trek to Home Affairs to apply for the new card ID and passport, and to the motor licensing bureau to renew my driverâ€™s licence. I shudder to think what awaits me on these visits. KEVIN GOVENDER Shallcross Daily News
