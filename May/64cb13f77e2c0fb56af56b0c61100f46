Teachers have been known to be serial malingerers. They enjoy the perks of every religious holiday off, enjoy a summer and winter vacation and two mini breaks in between annually. And they still have the cheek and audacity to bunk school, turning the tables with teachers playing truant instead of pupils. I agree that stress and fear could be major contributory factors to the rising absenteeism. Non-compliance with classroom ethics or after-school homework, downright rejection, threats and boisterous and intimidating behaviour from rude youngsters who physically outsize their teachers could elevate their stress and pressure levels, which could lead to a plethora of newly discovered ailments. The once prodigious servant of education has become a victim of the claustrophobic classroom. There are also many other reasons for absenteeism, like substance abuse. This needs urgent addressing by the Department of Education, and a starting point would be introducing the attendance bonus system. KEVIN GOVENDER Shallcross Daily News
