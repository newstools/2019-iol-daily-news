Already battling with staggering unemployment levels in the province and country, these disruptions do nothing but add to our burdens. Sadly our provincial Department of Economic Development seems more interested in outdoor advertising depicting our new premier inspecting cans of food. Under his leadership (as MEC For Economic Development, Tourism and Environmental Affairs), our economy was somewhat stagnant. He would of course argue that R200 billion of private investment was brought into the province. Among these are extensions to the Dube Tradeport. How this new logistics and economic zone is expected to thrive when there is continued strife in the transport sector will be interesting to watch. Economic development is not something that happens in a vacuum. It must be bolstered by proper economic principles, adequate policing and decent transport links. A singular approach where departments work in silos cannot be tolerated, and we will continue to push for this new crop of provincial politicians and the administration to get the basics right. Billboards and political grandstanding wonâ€™t create the jobs this province so desperately needs.
