This type of crime proves exactly how violent, brazen and fearless criminals are. The government is in denial, turning a blind eye and a deaf ear to this pandemic. I am also sceptical of the crime statistics regularly released by the police, as statistical permutations are easy to manipulate for political expediency and to effect a convenient cover-up. To our community, murder and robbery are daily occurrences and this is not going to stop unless drastic measures are taken by the police. The days of the police coming to the scene of a robbery, taking statements and the victims thereafter never hearing of any progress in the matter have to be stopped. This is not acceptable. We have to engage with a collective voice, insisting on our rights to be safe, as we run the risk of becoming lame duck potential victims. As taxpayers we have a right to be safe.
