There is no doubt that there are high expectations of the new Ramaphosa government. I believe his first priority must be to root out corrupt ministers and civil servants in order to address the pervasive corruption in the public sector. I am diligently following the Zondo Commission of Inquiry into State Capture. And just like how the Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo, is “horrified” at the “flagrant abuse and waste of taxpayers’ money” at Transnet, I am certain most citizens are just as horrified at the ongoing revelations of the different scandals. The large sums of public money that have been misused is sufficient evidence to prove that we have resources to address some of South Africa’s challenges, such as housing, and medical and educational facilities. Daily we read reports of corrupt activities in government departments by employees. Addressing corruption will improve the performance of local, provincial and national governments and their departments. Corruption, if left unchecked, will allow corrupt individuals to continue stealing from and will destroy the government’s ability to fulfil its commitment to the people. Corruption threatens the rule of law, damage s the country’s status, drives away investment and prevents economic growth. MOHAMED SAEED Pietermaritzburg Daily News
