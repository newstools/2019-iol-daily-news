Letter: Newlands, comprising Newlands West, Hillgrove, Earlsfield, Riverdene, Castle Hill and Briardale, is a sprawling township with a large population of Indians who have traditionally supported the DA. Although the party has a large support base in the area, we have never seen a DA councillor or public representative in our township for more than 20 years. I was, therefore, shocked and angered when I read in the media that the DA has not one, but two councillors representing the residents of Reservoir Hills, a little suburb compared to Newlands. I asked myself: “What is so special about Reservoir Hills that the DA has deployed two councillors in that ward?” Is it because it’s an elite area and the residents are super rich, hence the special treatment? It must be because I cannot think of any other reason. The residents of Newlands are keenly aware that service delivery has been severely lacking in our area. This is due to the fact that no DA councillor has been seen in Newlands for the past two decades, or issued any public statements in the media, reporting on activities pertinent to the area.
