Nedbank said it had signed on to give the young people work experience as part of its commitment to the YES initiative, nation-building and using its financial expertise to do good. YES, which was born out of the CEO Initiative, was launched in March last year by President Cyril Ramaphosa as a joint initiative between the government, business, labour and civil society. It was set up as part of a collective effort to address the youth unemployment crisis facing our country. To date, about 18000 recruits have been placed at various companies through YES initiatives, with 3315 starting at Nedbank and its implementation partners last week. “We are excited to be welcoming the youth intake and walking this new journey with them as they use the opportunity of a first job to develop their skills and experience to become leaders and inspiring, job-creating entrepreneurs,” said Nedbank group chief executive Mike Brown. Ramaphosa, who spoke at the induction ceremony, told the recruits their 12-month stints did not have to be the end of their career aspirations. “You should use this opportunity to take up other opportunities, open new doors and rise to greater heights,” he said.
