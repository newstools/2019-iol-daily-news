Durban- The Durban Fire and Emergency Services used the jaws of life cutting equipment to free the driver of a bakkie who allegedly slammed head-on into a truck in Clairwood,south of Durban on Thursday. The incident involving the truck and bakkie happened on Dayal Road in an area where residents are fighting against a truck invasion. The cause of the collision was unknown. Rescue Care Paramedics spokesperson Garrith Jamieson said the driver of the bakkie was trapped. "Our advanced life support paramedics stabilised the man while they try and create space to have the driver safely removed. The road has been closed to allow emergency personal to work on the scene," Jamieson said. The driver had been taken to a nearby hospital for treatment. The Clairwood Ratepayers and Residents Association have been fighting a losing battle against the eThekwini Municipality to stop the rezoning of residential properties into business and industrial sites. The ratepayer's spokesperson Ravin Brijlal has seen several homes being demolished in the past decade to make way for truck depots. Ratepayers were concerned that the inner roads were not wide enough to accommodate trucks. Daily News
