The school is sending two teams for this year’s competition, sponsored by Independent Media’s Daily News, Pretoria News, The Star and Cape Argus newspaper titles in partnership with the IIE’s Varsity College. Team A will consist of Sinaye Thusi, Bella-Donna Nwuwa, Amen Khwela and Sidona Meskele. “I am looking forward to winning,” said Bella-Donna. The team said their strong point was politics, with Amen saying policies such as land redistribution mattered to her. There was huge interest among the students when the call to enter went out, leading to the school submitting two teams for the competition. Team B will be represented by Lerato Tshabalala, Swazi Mavuso, Jozlyn Tucker and Renata Soobramoney. For Lerato, growing up in a home with politically active parents, it made sense for her to join the competition. “I watch the news all the time,” she said. “Politics? I love politics. My parents are into politics so I’m going into politics.” Although the teams don’t actively read newspapers, they are active online and regularly watch the news on television. “I really like keeping up with current affairs and expanding my knowledge about what’s going on in the world,” said Swazi. The school is planning on supplying the teams with Daily News papers in preparation for the quiz. Renata was motivated to join because of the sports category and she felt like she would add something different in terms of knowledge to her team. The Daily News, The Star, Pretoria News and Cape Argus will each host regional quizzes, with the top two teams from each region participating in the National High Schools Quiz Finals on September 19 at the Sandton campus of the IIE’s Varsity College, the main sponsor of the quiz. Competitors are expected to be knowledgeable on current affairs, sports, business, politics and international news.
