Your front-page story was presented in an objective and fair manner, a sign that the media refers to the courts and not politicians to make a final determination of the innocence or guilt of eThekwini mayor Zandile Gumede. I take no part in the public’s relish spreading like a virus on social media at the humiliation and shaming of Madame Gumede, for I believe in Lady Justice having the final say. Justice will be done, that’s a given. However, I also believe that Gumede should go on a sabbatical until her trial is concluded. I hope she takes to mind the treacherous pathway to the halls of justice. Included in your narrative must be the fact that Gumede voluntarily subjected herself to face Lady Justice and the fact that every accused person is a beneficiary to the right to a fair trial and not trial by social media. Thank you for a story that speaks to an issue that has to be resolved in a legal forum and that we, the public, should pack away our tar and feathers and allow justice to be served as a drink distilled with patience and time, rather than brewed in a furnace where prejudice and pre-judgments are the fuel. “Pro veritas” Daily News
