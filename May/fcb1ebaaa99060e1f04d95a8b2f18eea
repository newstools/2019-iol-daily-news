However, it is obvious the ANC is deeply divided and it remains to be seen if the party’s success in the elections is enough to give Ramaphosa a strong hand to deal with the miscreants. I do not claim to know all the ANC’s internal workings, but from reports I understand there are elements in the party, including secretary-general Ace Magashule, who are reluctant to give him credit. And I imagine it would be necessary - or at least important - to have the support of Magashule in acting against the corrupt. However, there are still serious allegations about Magashule himself stemming from his tenure as Free State premier, so how keen he will be to support Ramaphosa’s clean governance crusade remains to be seen.
