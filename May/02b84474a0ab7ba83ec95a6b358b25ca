The president and senior government officials, including ministers and MECs, were out in full force as they criss-crossed areas such as eManzimtoti, Chatsworth and Clare Estate, assessing the damage that has affected more than 1000 people. Ramaphosa promised that the government would provide financial support to areas and families that were affected by the disaster. A few weeks ago, Alexandra in Joburg, which is controlled by the DA, was burning. Residents were protesting about poor service delivery and demanded that mayor Herman Mashaba meet them over the non-delivery of basic services like waste removal, blocked drains, overflowing sewage and other essential services. The mayor refused to meet them, saying he had other commitments and would only see them in about two weeks. When Mashaba eventually met the community, angry residents sent him packing. There is a glaring contrast between the two leaders with regards to the crisis in Alexandra and eThekwini. The DA fell desperately short in a situation where the community was not asking for anything of an unreasonable nature, but simple basic services. The ANC to its credit responded positively by addressing the immediate needs of the flood victims. This is what good leadership and governance is all about. Mr President, you have my vote. Daily News
