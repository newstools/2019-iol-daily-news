Durban - The pristine uMhlanga beaches have been closed because lifeguards have been intimidated to join the eThekwini Municipality strike on Friday. The uMhlanga Urban Improvement Precinct (UIP) warned bathers that lifeguards have been forced to abandon their posts by other striking municipal workers resulting in a full beach closure in uMhlanga Rocks. "This intimidation has also affected our dedicated municipal beach and ablution-block cleaners, who came to work today but have no choice but to leave. The UIP will take over as much cleaning work as they can but note that there is a lot of debris on the beach that hasn't yet been cleaned. Apologies for this but please understand the situation these employees are in." a UIP statement read. A week long protest by the eThekwini water department, eThekwini electricity, eThekwini roads and the Durban Solid Waste has prompted the city management to take legal action against striking staff. The municipality refuses to explain how the salaries of 55 uMkhonto we Sizwe military veterans more than doubled in a year, saying that the matter was being investigated. Striking staff demand an equal pay package. On Facebook Jane Delahunty said, "I hope the strike is over before the Public Holiday next week. It’s absolutely disgusting. So many people have no jobs." Pat Moore said,"Intimidation right down the line. If you don't join them you are victimized." Daily News
