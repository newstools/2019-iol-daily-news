Durban - One person has died and two others were injured when a ski boat capsized about one kilometre out at sea neat Mtunzini in KwaZulu-Natal. IPSS Medical Rescue spokesperson Paul Herbst said a helicopter from Lenmed Health group has fetched three rescue swimmers from IPSS to assist. "Prelimenary reports are that two people are trapped on the boat and one person has unfortunately passed away," Herbst said. Mtunzini is a small coastal town that is situated almost exactly halfway along KwaZulu-Natal's coastline in South Africa approximately 140 km north of Durban. In April, six men had to be rescued when their fishing boat capsized near the Silt Canal at the entrance to the Durban port. National Sea Rescue Institute found a private fishing ski-boat with two men on board, in the water near the hull of their capsized boat. Police divers attached lines to the casualty boat and it was righted and recovered and no further assistance was required. Daily News
