Durban - The Congress of the South African Trade Unions (COSATU) in KwaZulu-Natal said government should get rid of lazy and redundant public servants and government officials. In a statement on Thursday, Provincial Secretary Edwin Mkhize said the democratic government struggles to transform society and the South African economy. Mkhize said it is obvious that the government is coming under enormous pressure from capital both at home and abroad. He said government and business need to do more to improve the livelihood of workers and South African's at large. "It becomes an urgent task for our government to put an end to retrenchments, increase opportunities for decent jobs and create a labour intensive economy.Â  There must be legislation to outlaw Labour Brokers, in-sourcing of the outsourced services must be expedited as part of building process and we need to urgently attend to the incapacity of the officials in many of our municipalities. Root out corruption,"he said. "We must get rid of lazy and redundant Public Servants and government officials, to give workers and the working class of South Africa a better life they deserve as Tax payers,"Mkhize added.
