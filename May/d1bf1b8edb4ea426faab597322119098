Durban - Fifty loggerhead turtles,each the size of a palm on your hand, have made at uShaka Marine World  in Durban their new home. The turtles were found stranded at various locations along the Cape coast and taken to the Two Oceans Aquarium where they received primary treatment. On Thursday , they arrived on a plane at King Shaka international airport and then transported to Ushaka marine world. Each weight no more than 150 grams. Ann Kunz, uShaka Sea World spokesperson, said staff at Two Oceans Aquarium have been very busy and are anticipating the arrival of even more stranded hatchlings who will require care and attention. "As uShaka Sea World is fortunate enough to have a specialised world class turtle rehabilitation facility and is positioned along the warm Indian Ocean it was clear that these 50 little turtles should spend their pre-release period in Durban whilst making way at Two Oceans for further patients,"she said. “If you find a turtle hatchling,on the beach, please do not put it back into the sea as it is clearly in trouble.  Rather pick it up and keep it dry, out of the wind and direct sunlight and place it, if possible, in a tub on piece of dry towel.  As soon as you are able, please call uShaka Sea World Turtle Rehabilitation Centre on 031 328 8222 (24 hours)” said senior Aquarist Malini Pather.
