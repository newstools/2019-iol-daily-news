Durban - A mass funeral for five of the eight people killed in a horror crash in Umdloti last week was held on Sunday at the Verulam Recreational Grounds. Six people were instantly killed when a truck and a light motor vehicle collided on the M27 between Umdloti and Mount Moreland on April 29 just before 3pm. Six others were seriously injured and two later succumbed to their injuries in hospital. According to Prem Balram, director of Reaction Unit SA the deceased were residents of Waterloo and Cottonlands in KZN. He said it is believed the victims had hitched a ride on the back of the bakkie when the accident occurred. They had been returning from work. "Reaction Officers found four occupants mangled in the wreckage of a silver Ford Bantam bakkie. Two other victims were found deceased after been ejected from the bakkie." Balram said it was one of the most horrific accident scenes. Daily News
