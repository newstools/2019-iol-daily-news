Durban - Clean-up operations have begun in most parts of eThekwini, after services were disrupted due to an illegal strike action by Municipal employees. As of Tuesday, the dispute between the workers and the Municipality was amicably resolved and all employees have resumed their duties. Domestic refuse collection and the restoration of water and electricity services has already begun. Water tankers are being delivered to communities affected by water shortage due to infrastructure malfunctioning that is unrelated to the strike. Teams from the various departments, particularly Durban Solid Waste, will work throughout the weekend to cover the backlog and ensure that the situation is restored to normality. Bags of domestic refuse where left on street corners in the Durban CBD and suburbs. In Sagittarius Street, Chatsworth the DSW garden refuse collection site was piled up with litter. It is alleged that residents were fed up with litter not being collected. They then left their bags on the pavement outside the collection site. The DSW began clearing the road of all the refuse bags on Friday. eThekwini Mayor Zandile Gumede apologised for the immense inconvenience that the illegal strike has caused. Daily News
