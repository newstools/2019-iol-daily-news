Durban - A R70 000 reward is being offered for information that could lead to the arrest and conviction of the person responsible for the murder of KwaZulu-Natal Philharmonic Orchestra musician Simon Milliken. The 60-year-old was killed at Burman Bush, in Morningside, Durban, while on a hike with friends last August. The popular musician’s murder caused widespread anger, resulting in eThekwini Municipality promising security upgrades to nature reserves in the city. However, the pace of the investigation into Milliken’s murder has concerned those close to him. His younger brother Jonathan was saddened that his killer has not been found yet. “I suspect there are people who know his identity and I beg them to contact the police with information,” he said. Jonathan, who lives in the UK, said he had met many people who described Milliken as a gentle person, who was loved by many. “Simon’s death has been hard to bear for myself and, especially, my mother, who is now more than 90 years old,” he said. Peace monitor Mary de Haas, who has been tracking the investigation, said the pace of investigations was worrying and the police were slow at following up leads. “The family does not understand why investigations are taking so long,” she said. Police spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said they were still conducting investigations.
