Durban - Chatsworth residents are up in arms over the "deplorable state" of ablution facilities in Woodhurst Park, Chatsworth. Leading the charge against the city's failure to maintain the facility is   Suren Ganapathie who represents Woodhurst Crime Watch, Star Street Crime Watch and Chatsworth Safety Alert. The park situated on Star Street opposite Parkview Primary School. It is also well utilised on weekends but Ganapathie said the condition of the toilets is not something ratepayers have been forking out money for. Ganapathie said the raised this matter at meetings with officials from the city over the past few years and was shocked to discover on Sunday that the toilets have still not been repaired and securely locked to prevent vandalism. " It has evidently been vandalised. Nothing has been done to prevent this. How do visitors relieve themselves... especially females?" said Ganapathie. Tony Govender, eThekwini ward 70 councillor, said he too could not get any response from the parks and gardens department on the matter. "I heard that insurance has paid out the city for the damages. The department has made lots of promises but to date, nothing has been done. It is not acceptable for people using the park to have such a facility," Govender said. The eThekwini Municipality had not responded to an email from the Daily News on what steps are being taken to upkeep the ablution facility. Daily News
