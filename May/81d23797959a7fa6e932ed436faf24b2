A water leak occurred on Wednesday, May 15, in Tagore Street, Gandhinagar, Tongaat. Millions of litres of water were wasted from Wednesday to Saturday when it was repaired. As a concerned ratepayer, I phoned 0311313013, and was given reference number 5190517/81. The same goes for street lights. High Street joins Watson Highway in the north and Henrietta Street in the south. Both latter streets join Gopalall Hurbans Road. All four streets had lights not working. It took weeks for them to be fixed. Why, about two weeks later, were the lights in High Street fixed, but not those in the other streets? This was a waste of transport, manpower and time. With your inauguration as president, we hope to get better service from people employed to do the work. LA Naidoo Tongaat Daily News
