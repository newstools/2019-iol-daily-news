Durban- The first two stranded sub-Antarctic fur seals of the "Stranding Season" were spotted on a beach on the KwaZulu-Natal coastline. Sub-Antarctic fur seals, South African fur seals and Southern elephant seals periodically wash up on KwaZulu-Natal beaches, sometimes thousands of kilometers from their home range said the South African Association for Marine Biological Research (SAAMBR). This usually happens between May and September each year. These seals are often exhausted when they reach our shores and need time to rest peacefully before returning to the sea. Seals on busy beaches are often harassed by public and their pets, so with the assistance of the KZN Marine Stranding Network, we relocate them to remote beaches where they can rest without disturbance. According to SAAMBR If seals are ill or injured, they are transported as soon as possible to the dedicated uShaka Sea World for treatment and rehabilitation. Recovery can take anything from a week to many months before a seal is strong enough to be released. What to do if you find a seal on the beach?
