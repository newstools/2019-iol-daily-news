Durban - Many Durban areas have been affected by the strike by the Cleansing and Solid Waste and Expanded Public Works Programme (EPWP). EThekwini Municipality spokesperson Msawakhe Mayisela said the Cleansing and Solid Waste (DSW) Unit were experiencing service interruptions due to an ongoing illegal strike action by EPWP workers. Refuse service collection and street sweeping in and around Durban was affected. “CSW is doing all it can to resolve the issues as speedily as possible for service to go back to normal. Residents are requested to keep all refuse within their properties. We would like to apologise for the inconvenience caused,” Mayisela said. On Wednesday and Thursday some areas did not have their refuse collected. Some of the areas that are affected are Durban North, Newlands, Chatsworth, Bellair, Malvern and others. On Facebook eThekwini ward 65 councillor Samantha Windvogel said: “Dear Residents Please be advised due to internal DSW problems refuse trucks are unable to go out once again TODAY. Residents should keep their refuse on their properties until further notice.” On Wednesday Tony Govender, eThekwini ward 70 councillor, said he received a message from the Chatsworth circuit manager of DSW informing him of the impending strike. "It could  affect other areas in Chatsworth and not only ward 70. I received a message from the circuit  manager informing me that there is an internal problem. Trucks are unable to go out of the depot. There will be service interruptions on Wednesday," he said. Daily News
