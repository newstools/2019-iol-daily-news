For example, many decades ago, while studying in India, if I had to communicate with my parents back home, it was a lengthy process. I had to write a letter, physically go to the post office, buy stamps and then post the letter and wait about a month for the response A similar process was followed by my parents to reply. In this chain of process, humans used to work. Today, with the dawn of the 4th Industrial Revolution, technology and trends such as the social media, videos, Internet of Things, robotics, virtual reality and artificial intelligence, just to name a few are changing the way we communicate, live and work. Within seconds and in real time, virtual reality will allow one to connect and socialise on a genuinely human level, with family, friends and business partners across the globe. Hence, a better approach to protesting would be to unlearn, relearn and revolutionise teaching and learning in order to manage the mismatch in the work environment, create employment, sustain jobs and build the workforce for the future.
