I must compliment the board on their purchase of three new furnaces, which are fully operational within a month of installation. The organisation can be proud to say that this is the best facility in the country. I pay my respects to the board, which saw the need in our community and had the vision to ensure the facility was maintained and upgraded so that our religious and cultural practices would be perpetuated. I dread to think what would have happened to our people if the Clare Estate Crematorium was not in existence. The same can’t be said for our parks department of the eThekwini Municipality. It is time for funeral directors to meet with new Premier Sihle Zikalala to investigate the unnecessary eight-year delay in bringing the Mobeni Heights Crematorium to full operational capability. Maybe it’s time for heads to roll. I thank the chairman, Mr Nundkissore, and his dedicated and enthusiastic board members for their spontaneous and ongoing support. You are the living example of this powerful quote of Mahatma Gandhi: “The best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others." Dhayalan Moodley Mobeni Heights Daily News
