At the heart of these resignations lies the fact that the white caucus is unhappy that blacks are beginning to dominate the party. For the first time in history, the DA was able to win municipalities controlled by the ANC. This happened because it opened its doors to South Africans of all races. Without the black vote the DA is nothing; it can never hope to challenge the ANC as “the government in waiting”. The DA is now naked and its hidden agenda is exposed for all to see. This was really a project created to protect white interests, and many racists hide behind the party, calling themselves “liberals”. Black members realised that they were being used to bring in votes. They are not good for anything else. The DA will become a white party once, more fighting for white interests. The DA gets lots of its support from Indians. Indian DA leaders are silent over the developments because they are career politicians who have sold our future for a salary. They cannot survive in any other political party and are singing for their supper. This spells doom and gloom for our future and that of our children. We will be put on the same bandwagon as racists and the blacks in this country will never forgive us. I call on the DA Indian leaders to distance themselves from the racist white cabal that is taking over the party. Do it for the sake of our future and our kids. SABEENA CHETTY Durban Daily News
