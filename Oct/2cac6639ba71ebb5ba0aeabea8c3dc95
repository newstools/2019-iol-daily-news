Yesterday, Durban’s Senuran Muthusamy fulfilled that dream during the Freedom Series in India, when he took the wicket of Indian captain Virat Kohli. Muthusamy removed Kohli in the 104th over off a leading edge which the batsman sent back to Muthusamy for an easy return catch, dismissing the skipper for 20 runs. Speaking from India, Muthusamy said from day one he learned that you have to compete with every ball bowled, which paid off when he bagged his first international Test scalp on day two of the first Test match between India and South Africa in Visakhapatnam. An elated Muthusamy said his mother was “over the moon”.  As for his first Test wicket being the number two Test batsman in the world, Muthusamy barely had words. “Unforgettable,” he gasped.
