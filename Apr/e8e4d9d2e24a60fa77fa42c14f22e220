Durban - A knack for spotting criminal behaviour led the Community Crime Prevention Organisation (CCPO)  to the recovery of a replica firearm in the Amanzimtoti CBD on Monday. At around 10 am today CCPO supervisor Michael and a Blue Security officer were busy in Amanzimtoti CBD when they noticed a person behaving suspiciously. The CCPO stopped and checked the man.  They found a realistic looking toy gun under his shirt. He was handed over to Amanzimtoti SAPS for further investigation. This morning in Amanzimtoti, there was also an attempted business break-in at Arbour Crossing but the suspects were disturbed by the center security. The suspects fled empty-handed. At 03:00 a CCPO patrol surprised two suspects in John Craven road, Amanzimtoti, carrying a flat screen TV. Unfortunately, the suspects escaped into Ezimangweni. The TV was not recovered. Yesterday, a house break-in occurred at a complex on Ridge Road, Amanzimtoti during the night. Cellphones, laptops and wallets were stolen. Daily News
