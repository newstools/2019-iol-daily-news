If my memory serves me correctly, the veterans were hired at the behest of Mayor Zandile Gumede and one surmises that the increases were also granted at her behest. It is understandable that other, non-MK members, working in the same departments are angry that these seemingly specially anointed individuals are suddenly earning twice their salaries after barely a year in employment and, according to them, despite not being very good at their jobs. The increases are surely in breach of the Municipal Finance Management Act and the Public Finance Management Act. Whoever is responsible for policing compliance with these pieces of legislation - presumably the Co-operative Governance Department - is duty-bound to investigate what appears to be a travesty. Those workers who did not get the increases are now understandably striking, but this comes at the worst possible time when their labour is desperately needed to repair the damage from last week's storm. Many communities are without water and require assistance. This matter needs an immediate solution and for those responsible for its creation to be brought to book. A. KHAN Durban Daily News
