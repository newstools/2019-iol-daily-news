Cape Town - ANC secretary general Ace Magashule's birthday wishes to former president Jacob Zuma conveniently left out the word "former". "I'd like to wish President @PresJGZuma a happy birthday. Ukhule Nxamalala,"Â Magashule tweeted on Friday. The embattled ANC NEC member was admonished by numerous people but a large number of supporters endorsed his message, saying that there are "no former presidents in the liberation movement". Zuma, who turns 77 today, has a huge following and #ZumaDay was trending on Friday as birthday wishes streamed in for Umsholozi.     I'd like to wish President @PresJGZuma a happy birthday.
