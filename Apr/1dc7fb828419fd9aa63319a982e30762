Durban - A tow truck driver has become the latest victim of a tow truck dispute in Phoenix on Sunday. Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane, a KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson, said the Asheel Ramdass was in his vehicle parked at Sunford drive when a white Etios stopped and the occupants opened fire towards the car. "The victim died at the scene and motive unknown. The suspects later hijacked another vehicle which was a VW Vivo vehicle. Suspects are still at large. Toyota Etios was later recovered and it was stolen at Sydenham this month,"Zwane said. Zwane said police were working on several leads but no arrests have been made. Nearly a year ago Lazarus Fee Naidoo was shot dead in a similar drive-by shooting outside the same home in Sunford. Naidoo of Durban North owned Gypsy Towlines and mini-bus taxis.  Naidoo, a father of two, was shot seven times in the back and died on his way to hospital. Naidoo’s wife, Sharlene, 38, and sons are devastated. Police arrested one person for the incident but it is unclear what transpired during the court proceedings since then. Naidoo had received death threats from a rival towing company from Pheonix. Daily News
