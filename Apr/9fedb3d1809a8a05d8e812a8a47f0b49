Durban - The National roads, N3 and N2, traversing through KwaZulu-Natal have no structural damages despite several points being flooded when heavy rain fell over the province. Sections of the N2 near the old Durban airport at Isipingo, at Prospecton interchange and at Amanzimtoti near the Galleria Mall were flooded on Tuesday morning. The N3 was partially blocked at Shongweni and the Mariannhill toll plaza due to mudslides. No major structural damage has been reported to roads and bridges within SANRAL’s jurisdiction, said Dumisani Nkabinde, SANRAL Eastern Region regional manager. "There would be a recurrence of flooding of the N2 just south of Durban if the rain did not stop long enough. Sections of the road were in a flood plain,"Nkabinde said. He said the maintenance of the culverts within SANRAL's jurisdiction was regularly done. After every significant rainfall event, culverts were checked and cleared of debris. Meanwhile SANRAL records its appreciation and gratitude to all emergency teams and rescue services that assisted following the widespread flooding. “The safety of motorists and pedestrians using our roads is paramount. Our emergency response teams are working closely with road traffic authorities and other emergency personnel to ensure the safety of all road users,"Nkabinde said. He urged motorists to be extra vigilant during bad weather and advised them to plan their trips in consultation with the Advanced Traveller Information System (www.i-traffic.co.za). Daily News
