I would like to inform him that the government could probably have built twice that number of houses, and possibly more, if the corruption in the provision of social housing was addressed. Stories of the politically connected repeatedly getting multimillion-rand contracts to build houses, despite evidence of shoddy construction on previous projects, are common, including in Durban. Then the government must spend millions more “rectifying” such construction, with no evidence of any penalties being levied on the developer. Ramaphosa was quoted in the same article saying that those appointed to public office after the elections would deliver services to voters and not steal money. I’m afraid I find this difficult to believe, looking at the names on the ANC’s national candidates list, from which the ministers would presumably be appointed. There are far too many from the Zuma era with serious allegations against their names for me to take the president at his word. Get rid of these people and then I could begin to take him seriously.
