Durban -Tourists and local beach users cleaned up the uMhlanga sea shores of debris and plastics, on Thursday, following heavy rain falls over the province. The Durban coastline has been filled with debri, tree barks and plastic bottles and general waste. The Durban harbour was also filled with litter in certain areas. The uMhlanga Urban Improvement Precinct (UIP) stated that the uMhlanga Rocks beaches have been closed by the local lifeguards due to debris and dirty water flushed from the river into the sea after the heavy rains. The UIP said they will recheck the water at midday and reassess the situation. Locals and tourists alike arrived in uMhlanga Rocks to help the UIP and EThekwini Municipality teams clean the litter. The UIP is appealing to those who would like to assist to bring refuse bags, rakes and gloves. All full refuse bags can be left at the base of the stairs to the promenade for the UIP to remove.
