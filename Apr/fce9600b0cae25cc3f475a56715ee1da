He mentioned the training some comrades underwent on the use of explosives, and he specifically mentioned that civilians “must not be harmed”. Damage was to be done to utilities and related infrastructure, but no human life must be taken. He went on to say that “comrades were to take an oath to this effect”. Why then did Andrew Zondo and Robert McBride go against the ANC's directive and harm innocent people? Zondo planted a bomb at a shopping complex in eManzimtoti which destroyed innocent people including children, and McBride planted a bomb at Magoo's Bar on the Durban beach front that took the lives of a number of innocent people. The victims' only crime was that they were all white. Yet these bombers were recognised as heroes by the ANC; Zondo had a street named after him and McBride was given a top position in government.
