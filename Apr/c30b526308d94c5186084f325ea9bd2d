The extreme deterioration and neglect of the city should have served notice to the governing party and councillors that something is rotten in the capital city of KwaZulu-Natal. The potholes, dysfunctional street lights, lack of visible traffic-policing, water leaks in numerous parts of the city, garbage lying all over, blocked manholes, roads and pavements in a state of disrepair, to name just a few issues, ought to have been the wake-up call to the councillors that Msunduzi is heading towards becoming a dysfunctional city. Residents pay their high rates, taxes and electricity bills diligently, and therefore expect to receive these services from the council. But sadly, the service-delivery level from the council is sickening. According to the Companies Act and the King Report on Corporate Governance, a breach of duties as a company director can hold serious consequences for a director. Hence, I believe municipalities should be run according to the Companies Act, so in the event of negligence, malpractice and mismanagement, councillors could also be held responsible for the lack of service delivery, neglect of the city and mismanagement of finances. It is time that political parties, members of Parliament and councillors were held accountable, like company directors. MOHAMED SAEED Pietermaritzburg
