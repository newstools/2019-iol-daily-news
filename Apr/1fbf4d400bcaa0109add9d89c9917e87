Food prices will increase, including staples like maize meal, flour, bread, salt, potatoes and rice. Bus and taxi fares will increase. The price of basic clothing will go up. Personal grooming product prices will increase, meaning the poor will not be able to take care of their basic hygiene needs anymore. Disposable income will decrease. We are headed for this, thanks to the ANC. When will the poor masses wake up and realise their power and bring the government to its knees? People Against Petrol and Paraffin Price Increases (Papppi) has embarrassed and exposed the dodgy dealings of ANC leaders. The ANC president and parliamentary portfolio committees, chaired by ANC cadres, have consistently shown Papppi and South Africans the middle finger. They have shown time and again that they do not care about addressing corruption within the fuel sphere. It’s time to call this ANC government to order. You don’t have to vote for any other party, for none of them has championed the fuel crisis as Papppi has. But make the ANC accountable. Allow them not a wink of sleep until they bring the price of fuel down to improve the life of the poor man. The ANC needs to act now to bring fuel prices down.
