There are only two parties in South Africa with the capacity to run government as a coalition leader or outright majority. They are both in government at different levels. The questions voters should ask are: Which of the two biggest parties has 1) the track record of good governance and 2) a good reputation of fighting corruption and holding its people to account? We often get caught up in the noise of elections: scandals, breaking news, clickbait headlines, when the question to be asked is: “Who governs better?” We should also ask: “How do the hundreds of pop-up parties think they will make a dent in the plethora of major issues facing our country - if they cannot run a small village? If we constantly search for a “perfect” party, we will set ourselves up for disappointment, because parties are made up of people and people are flawed. But what we must not accept is parties that are unable to hold their own people to account, or those where corruption has become institutionalised to a point where government fails to deliver on its constitutional mandate. Good governance versus institutionalised corruption: it’s your choice. Councillor Christopher Pappas (DA) eThekwini Municipality, Ward 31 Daily News
