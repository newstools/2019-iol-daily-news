Bright Hlongwane, 22, will speak at the UN headquarters in New York. “I am excited to be sharing my vision with the world. My mom is proud of me. It’s hard because I recently lost my father and I wish he was here to witness this,” he said. Hlongwane’s speech is titled “Promoting youth participation in decision-making”. “I always say ‘nothing for us, without us’. We need the youth to be present in the decision-making processes that affect us,” he said. “We can’t let people who won’t be around in the future make decisions for young people today.” Hlongwane said he was invited by the UN, an affirmation of his accomplishments. He is the founder/owner of Isimangaliso Group, a company that deals with media, information technology and marketing. He has a Diploma in Public Administration and Management from Mangosuthu University of Technology and a certificate in Advanced Entrepreneurship from Stanford University in the US. Daily News
