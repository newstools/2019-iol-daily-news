While United started off fearlessly and confidently at the Catalan stronghold, playing attacking football, it all petered out when Lionel Messi fired two shots past David de Gea, the second of which was a horrible blunder for a goalkeeper of his ability. Not even show-boating French international Paul Pogba, who was re-signed in 2016 for a world record fee of £90millions, and who apparently owns a fleet of luxury cars - from a Bentley to Rolls-Royce, could rescue United. He appeared to not be in the game and proved to be no match against the Messi magic. United went to Barcelona with a swagger but left with their tails between their legs. Solksjaer was given a harsh lesson by Barcelona, losing 4-0 on aggregate. Sorry to all the die-hard United fans. You’re gone very quiet. It could be Liverpool’s time. T Markandan Silverglen Daily News
