Durban - The heavy downpour of rain has caused some damage to the Durban Central Post office on Thursday. Nobuhle Njapha, a spokesperson for the South African Post Office said the post office at Dr Pixley KaSeme (West) Street would be temporarily closed for business on Thursday due to damage caused by flooding. "The office will re-open on Saturday. Customers can use alternative post offices in the Durban central business district. We apologise for the inconvenience," she said. Customers can use Joseph Ndluli (Russell) Street post office or OR Tambo (Marine Parade) post office. A sinkhole has also appeared at the intersection of Old Dutch Road and Warwick Avenue. In Durban suburbs, several roads and intersections had filled with water making it dangerous for cars to drive through. The rains also brought litter out of the storm water drains and onto the beach in Umhlanga and at Durban's Blue Lagoon. Daily News
