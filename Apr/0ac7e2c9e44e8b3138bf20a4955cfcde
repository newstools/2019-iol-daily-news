Spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said the child went missing on Saturday morning. He said on Wednesday night the body of a 1-year-old child was found in the bush in Loft Manor near Trenance Manor where the Ohlanga River separates Phoenix and Amaoti. “The post-mortem will determine the cause of death. We are looking at various scenarios and could make an arrest soon,” Zwane said. Gareth Naidoo, spokesperson for KZN VIP Unit security, said they received several frantic calls from residents informing them that a baby was found dead. “We found the baby had a packet over the head and neck. The baby was in a state of decomposition. The parents were on the scene. Paramedics declared the child dead. It was traumatising for staff to see the little boy in that state,” Naidoo said. The boy’s family are from Amaoti and could not be reached for comment. A source said a man had called the baby’s stepfather several times about the child since Saturday. Eventually, the stepfather received a call that the baby was dead. He was allegedly told the whereabouts of the body. Police are investigating a case of murder. Daily News
