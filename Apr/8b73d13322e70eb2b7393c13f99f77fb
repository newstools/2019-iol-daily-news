While many in the private sector are not receiving increases, or are making do with below-inflation increases, government employees make ridiculous demands like the 11.4% being demanded by SA Revenue Service (Sars) workers. I think Sars is being generous in offering a 7% increase - I certainly would be grateful for a 7% increase. We were given the option of a 4% increase which would lead to some staff being retrenched, or no increase but everybody keeping their jobs. We chose to ensure that all our colleagues are able to provide for their families and agreed to forego an increase. But such thinking and magnanimity appears to be beyond most government employees, buoyed no doubt by seeing how much their ANC-deployed managers are earning. W. VENTER Pietermaritzburg Daily News
