To win the coveted trophy and become champions of the world, at least in the 50-over format, South Africa has the talent to achieve this. One area that is critical is that of spin bowling. While there are many contenders, I would suggest that Keshav Maharaj gets the nod. A prodigious spinner who has proven himself on the world stage, with statistics to match, Maharaj should be given an opportunity to display his talents and also be groomed for future world events. While Imraan Tahir, in the twilight of his career, has been excellent in this role, I do believe that Maharaj will equal, if not, better Tahir's exploits in the World Cup should he be given the opportunity. South Africa has the best opportunity to achieve what was never done before, and to leave Maharaj out of the side would be a travesty. I hope that the convener of selectors sees fit to include this most promising talent in the spin so we can achieve an accolade that we so desperately want. History beckons!
