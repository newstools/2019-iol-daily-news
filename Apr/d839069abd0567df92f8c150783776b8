The price variances are huge and if the seller is not happy, he should simply not sell - that’s my advice. Keep the land and find a better buyer. Why are you forcing the city to buy at your price? Willing buyer, willing seller. No one is forcing the seller to sell, and here does the EFF have any advice regarding expropriation without compensation? Graveyard space is a compelling and growing need. The (Pietermaritzburg) Msunduzi Municipality is in a mess, reduced from a fine-run city to the financial chaos it finds itself in today. eThekwini is hanging on by a thread and there is just a tiny number of officials giving it some degree of sanity and respectability. It’s only a matter of time before eThekwini will be in the same predicament as Pietermaritzburg. As for the likes of Mr Kumar and many other officials, you can rest assured that giving people the run-around is a universal trait and not confined to one race only. I can vouch for that.
