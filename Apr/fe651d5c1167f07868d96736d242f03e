Durban - An eThekwini ward councillors secretary was robbed in her office in Newlands East on Wednesday. It is alleged that two men walked into ward 11 councillor Joyce Johnson office on Marble Ray Drive and robbed the secretary of her handbag. The men fled on foot down Marble Ray Drive towards Inanda Road and got into their getaway vehicle. The car registration number, taken down by witnesses, was also false and did not match the vehicle according to a source. The vehicle number plate was cloned and belonged to an Isuzu bakkie. The secretary is at the Newlands East police station where a case is being opened. Councillor Johnson could not be reached for comment. On the Newlands East Watch Facebook page, Tracey Vezasie said, "Not good at all.  People be vigilant. Please report any crime if your gut feeling says something wrong do something about it. I don't think it is trivial." Daily News
