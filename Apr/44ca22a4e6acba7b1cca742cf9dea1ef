Durban -  The South African National Defence Force was called in today to assist people trapped by flooding after torrential rains pounded parts of KwaZulu-Natal overnight. Defence and Military Veterans Minister  Mapisa-Nqakula on Tuesday instructed members of the defence force to assist in flooded areas in and around Port St Johns. Several homes in the area were submerged. At least ten people were confirmed dead on Tuesday morning and hundreds of homes damaged.  Several roads leading into the city were flooded. The death toll was expected to rise as emergency personnel were still compiling the numbers. The South African Weather Services Lebogang Makgati said more rain is expected until Wednesday. She said 173 mm of rain fell over Durban in 24 hours. "Heavy rains have battered the South African coastline. The weather system is expected to exit the country from the east coast of the eastern cape on Thursday," she said. Police search and rescue, emergency services and private ambulance services had their hands full out on the field with some describing it as an absolute disaster with many terrible tragedies; houses and walls collapsed.
