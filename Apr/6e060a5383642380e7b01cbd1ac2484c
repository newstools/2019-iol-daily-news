You did not respond to the other very important points I have made. Good manners is not about supporting corruption, state capture or looting; it’s about exposing the truth. Ramaphosa had been deputy president while all of this was happening. He knew full well that our country was being raped by his comrades, but did nothing to stop the scourge and instead voted against the motion of no confidence to oust Jacob Zuma. It is not just Zuma alone, but much of the ANC Cabinet that has benefited from the looting. Did you take into account that we citizens have lost trillions through corruption while Ramaphosa was deputy? Every SOE in this country is in ruins. Why? Eskom is a perfect example. It has plunged this country into darkness because the money intended for our electricity security went into ANC cronies’ pockets. SAA, Prasa, Sassa, SABC, Sapo and Transnet have all failed under the ANC leadership and while Ramaphosa did nothing. Why are we facing electricity, fuel and VAT increases? It is to cover the huge shortfall that has been looted. You didn't respond to these issues. Not bad manners, but the truth. Jason Naidoo Durban Daily News
