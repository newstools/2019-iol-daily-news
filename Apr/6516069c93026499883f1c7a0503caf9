Switch off the car radio and concentrate on your surroundings. -Remember to stop your vehicle just on the inside of the gate and select reverse whilst waiting for the gate to close. This creates confusion and may buy you a few seconds for the gate to close completely behind you. -Check your driveway and street before you leave or enter your premises. -Make sure your driveway is well lit and clear from shrubbery where perpetrators can hide. -Phone your home and ask for someone to make sure your driveway is safe and to open and close the gate for you. -When returning home after dark, ensure that an outside light is on, or have someone meet you at the gate. -If your children are older, it is advised that they exit the vehicle with you when opening the gate so that you are all separated from the vehicle should an attack occur.
