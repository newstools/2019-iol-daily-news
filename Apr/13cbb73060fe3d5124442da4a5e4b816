With the dawn of democracy, we thought that residential apartheid was buried in history. But we were wrong. Late last year the DA lodged an objection with the eThekwini Municipality against Gold Circle hosting social events at Greyville Racecourse, a popular racing venue in the middle of a predominantly white area. Social events such as weddings, cultural concerts and trade fairs at Greyville Racecourse are attended mostly by Indians. We now have a Durban North Indian businessman who is being victimised by white residents in the area for hosting a birthday party for his elderly mother at the weekend. DA ward councillor Heinz de Boer was also unhappy and had urged the residents to call the Metro Police and complain about the “noisy” party. This is the party that the majority of Indians foolishly believe is their saviour. It is time the Indian community woke up and smelt the coffee. They now need to realise that the DA is only using us as voting fodder and nothing else. Prakash Singh Phoenix Daily News
