If smaller parties were not relevant, then can the DA explain why it begged smaller parties to form a coalition where it governs? The DA must acknowledge that smaller parties play a pivotal role within the political spectrum, by helping to shape legislation and determine policies in government. It is the smaller parties that focus on real bread and butter issues affecting our communities. Smaller parties often determine the outcome of elections and this is the reason why these parties will continue to play a significant role in the future of our country. Lies will become truth if we continue to believe in the DA's propaganda. So let us stop being manipulated by the DA, and vote for a party that's going to make a difference in our lives.
