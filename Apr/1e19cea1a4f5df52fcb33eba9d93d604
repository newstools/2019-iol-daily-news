We have many challenges in Reservoir Hills. It was with hope and expectation that I voted for the DA in the last local government elections. But hope turned to disappointment and anger when our DA ward councillor absconded from the ward and service delivery became non-existent. Complaints to the DA leadership fell on deaf ears. But what really concerns us is Mmusi Maimane’s public pledge that the DA will work closely with the EFF to govern South Africa. We know what the EFF stands for and its track record regarding race relations in South Africa. A DA-EFF coalition would be a nightmare and a disaster for South Africa. A large majority are impressed with the way President Cyril Ramaphosa is tackling state capture and corruption, and his commitment to good governance. We have high hopes that he will lead us out of the mess the country is in. On May 8, I know where I will be putting my “X”. Daniel Pillay Reservoir Hills Daily News
