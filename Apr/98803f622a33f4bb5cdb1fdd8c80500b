Use your vote, don’t waste it. On May 8, get out of the house/flat (it is a public holiday) and take a walk to your voting station. Get some exercise for your body and exercise your right to vote. Feel like a good citizen again. Don’t let yourself or your vote be taken for a ride. When you are offered a free ride over the short distance, know that that will be all you get in exchange for your vote in the next five years from that party. Don’t be cheap, don’t be used. Be Good, do Good, vote Good. If you don’t vote, you allow leaders and parties you don’t like to get into power in Parliament and your province. This is not a vote for a councillor. Here the parties choose who represents you. You have no idea which person you vote in through that party. Find out who is going to represent you as MP. Find a good party with a good person to represent you and vote for them. Robin Naidoo Phoenix Daily News
