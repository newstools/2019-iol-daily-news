The 32-year-old, who cannot be named to protect the identity of the newborn and her two other minor siblings, is facing a charge of attempted murder. Her attorney, Jacques Botha, made an unopposed application to magistrate Ravi Pillay, requesting that she be able to see her two other children - a 15-year-old son and 9-year-old daughter - over the Easter weekend. Pillay granted the application. She is, however, still barred from having any contact with the infant, who is being kept at a place of safety. The court heard that the State was still awaiting results from DNA tests and a statement from a rescue worker. Natasha Kara, National Prosecuting Authority regional spokesperson, said the matter was adjourned until July 8 for further investigation. It was reported in February that the baby girl was heard crying from a stormwater drain in Newlands East by a passer-by, who had called for assistance. A number of medical teams responded to the scene, where the concrete and pipe had to be cut to rescue the child, who was believed to be between a day and three days old. The rescue mission took four hours. Daily News
