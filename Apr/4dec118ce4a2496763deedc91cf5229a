Durban - News that water in the eThekwini Municipality was contaminated was classified as a hoax by city officials on Tuesday. eThekwini Municipality City Manager, Sipho Nzuza, assured the public that water delivered to all residents is not contaminated. "The city has been inundated with calls from residents trying to ascertain the veracity of this incorrect information. We are very concerned with lies making rounds that our water is not clean,"Nzuza said. Water is very important in sustaining human life, he said, and under no circumstances shall the city compromise on that. Nzuza said the city has water experts who are responsible for ensuring that without fail clean drinking water is provided. Even the water that we happen to provide with water tankers in times of emergencies is clean. "Some residents received information to the effect that in certain areas water is laden with pathogens which are microorganisms that have a deadly potential to trigger diseases such as diarrhoea," Nzuza said. “We understand that it is the electioneering period and some would want to be seen to be doing something by their bosses by peddling lies. We are calling for responsible leadership to all political leaders in our communities and refrain from sending communities in panic mode solely to score cheap political points at the expense of the welfare of our communities. We are fully aware of reports of water borne diseases in northern parts of the country, but not here” said Nzuza. Daily News
