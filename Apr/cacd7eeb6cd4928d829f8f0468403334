How else can one explain the complaint laid by the DA with the Independent Electoral Commission regarding ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule? Magashule had handed out cash to a woman when he saw that there was no food in her fridge, during a door-to-door campaign in Philippi, Cape Town, last week. The DA’s complaint is that this is “buying votes” or “votes for cash”. Magashule is certainly not the first politician or the last to give a voter something while on the campaign trail. T-shirts and food parcels are handed out by the thousands by political parties during election campaigns. Is that not a gift? For someone who has very few clothes, is a T-shirt not a significant gift? And one wonders what the reaction would have been from DA supporters if the person handing out the cash had been party leader Mmusi Maimane? Would they have condemned Maimane? Certainly not. They would have defended his action. Such is the hypocrisy of the DA. Ronnie Pillay Durban Daily News
