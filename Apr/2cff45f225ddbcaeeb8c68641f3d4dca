They are stating that, after the elections, the ANC will throw President Cyril Ramaphosa to the wolves and replace him with Ace Magashule. With opinion polls showing that a large number of whites, Indians and coloureds will be supporting the ANC, the DA is resorting to spreading fake news. It must be noted that the Independent Electoral Commission has ordered the DA to apologise to Patricia de Lille for telling voters the party had fired her. As a long-standing member of the ANC, I can assure voters that the anti-Ramaphosa faction is in the minority. Everything points to the ANC winning the elections by a landslide. Ramaphosa will have the mandate of the people to address the many challenges facing the country, and to bring to book those responsible for state capture. Ramesh Sukdeo Durban Daily News
