Durban - The Kloof and Highway SPCA hosted their first outreach clinic for 2019 in the Fredville area of Inchanga. During the 3-day clinic a total of 218 animals were sterilised and treated. Brigitte Ferguson, the Kloof SPCA spokesperson, said pet owners were also educated on caring for their animals by the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) Outreach Team. Each animal treated at the clinic was sterilised, vaccinated, dewormed and treated for ticks and fleas and sent home with a warm blanket and food. "The staff and volunteers have worked extremely hard to make a difference in these animals lives as well as having a huge impact on the community as a whole. None of this would have been possible without our supporters and donors. Thank you for making a difference. These animals have no voice to speak out against cruelty and neglect and it is our society's aim to be the voice of the animals in need," Ferguson said. Daily News
