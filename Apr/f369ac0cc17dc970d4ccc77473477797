“The world is coming to buy Africa. Only by showcasing ourselves will we see economic improvement.” Kotze-Nhlapo was speaking at the media launch of the 30th Africa Travel Tourism Indaba to be held from May 2-4 at Durban’s International Convention Centre. The theme for this year’s Indaba is “Africa Stories, this is your time to shine.” An African success story, Agnes Vermaak shared her story of starting from letting out a room to having her own guest house franchise. Vermaak, the owner of JoTham’s guest house, will be exhibiting for the third time at the tourism indaba. Phindile Makwakwa, acting chief executive of Tourism KwaZulu-Natal, said the goal of the indaba was to bring the world to Africa. “Small business enterprises get the opportunity to pitch their ideas and businesses to the rest of the world.” With less than a month left to the showpiece, Makwakwa said all the exhibition spaces had been sold out. Last year, there were more than 1000 exhibitions. Siza Sibanda, from the office of the MEC for Tourism, appealed to have the indaba permanently hosted in Durban. Daily News
