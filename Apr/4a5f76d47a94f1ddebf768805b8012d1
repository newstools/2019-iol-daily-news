    "Preliminary investigation reveals that on Wednesday around 11pm, a minibus taxi, a golf and two trucks collided, killing five people on scene. Ten people sustained minor injuries and were taken to Madadeni Hospital for further medical attention. All five deceased were from the minibus.  It is alleged that the deceased were traveling from Johannesburg to Newcastle," he said. “As we are approaching the Easter weekend, the province is expecting a high volume of vehicles on the N3 since the KZN is a holiday destination for many local and international tourists. We therefore urge motorists to abide by the roles and be patient with one another,” he said. Sunday Tribune
