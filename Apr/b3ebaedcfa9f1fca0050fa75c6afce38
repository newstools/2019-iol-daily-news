Durban - The Giba Gorge Nature Reserve was forced to be vigilant following illegal plant harvesting. In a Facebook post, the Giba Gorge Nature Reserve - GGEP (Giba Gorge Environmental Precinct) said illegal plant harvesting can be an issue at the gorge. Recently, the conservation manager, Thuthuka Majola and the Giba Gorge Environmental Team  recovered six bags of illegally harvested plants. “As a result eThekwini Municipality and Giba Gorge Management have arranged for patrols, by KSA security, to counter illegal harvesting in the gorge and along the N3 corridor each day until the end of June. Thanks to both eThekwini Municipality and Giba Gorge Management for the maintenance and protection of our environment,” the post said. However, the eThekwini Municipality said the reserve is managed by KZN Wildlife with some assistance from the conservancies. The municipality does not play a major role in that but when poachers are spotted, field rangers work with KZN Wildlife to deal with poachers or illegal harvesters of muthi plants. Daily News
